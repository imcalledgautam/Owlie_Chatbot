Brussolo 0, Maria Hasenhuttl @h1562, Julie Haworth @haworthProfessors of Practice: Alexander Edsel 0Assistant Professor of Practice: Guido Tirone 1 Degree Requirements The Master of Science in Marketing (MS MKT) is a minimum 36 semester credit hour degree program that is designed to meet the needs of students in today's data-driven marketplace, in which the exponential growth in data generated from store scanners and web transactions, navigation, search, and more recently, social media, requires new marketing skills and knowledge. Students may choose from any of the tracks listed below as part of their degree program. Advertising and Brand Management Consumer & Shopper Insights Digital Advertising and Marketing Marketing Analytics Marketing Management Product Management To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS degree. Students can also obtain a double MS and MBA degree by taking a total of 63 semester credit hours (assuming they meet all the degree requirements for both programs). Prerequisite Students pursuing the Master of Science in Marketing degree program must complete one semester credit hour of the MAS 6102 Professional Development course. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites. However, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). As a degree-seeking student, all program prerequisites must be satisfied within the first semester of graduate study. Course Requirements Core Courses: 15 semester credit hours MKT 6301 Marketing Management MKT 6309 Marketing Data Analysis and Research MKT 6310 Consumer Behavior Science and Practice MKT 6339 Capstone Marketing Decision Making or MKT 6350 Marketing Strategy and Game Theory Framework Choose from one of the following statistics courses: MKT 6379 Marketing by Numbers or OPRE 6301 Statistics and Data Analysis (suggested for the Consumer and Shopper Insights track) or OPRE 6359 Advanced Statistics for Data Science (suggested for the Marketing Analytics track) Note that statistics is a required prerequisite for many analytics courses in JSOM. If a student takes MKT 6379 Marketing by Numbers and decides later to also take OPRE 6359, MKT 6379 Marketing by Numbers will remain as their core class. Students however may use OPRE 6359 as the unrestricted course/prefix three-semester credit hour master's level course within JSOM as an elective in the degree plan. Specialized Tracks: 21 semester credit hours Choose from one of the following five specialized tracks or from the Marketing Management Track. Tracks are for guidance and informational purposes; they will not appear on your degree or transcript. Students may change tracks as long as they can complete the plan requirements. The Marketing Management track offers the most flexibility for those wishing to change tracks or combine courses from different tracks. Students pursuing the degree entirely online should follow the Marketing Management track given that the other five specialized tracks may not have all the courses available online. Students may substitute only one three-semester credit hour master's-level course from any unrestricted course/ prefix offered within JSOM as an elective in the degree plan.

The School offers five MBA programs: MBA Full-Time Cohort, Professional MBA Evening Cohort, Professional MBA Flex, Professional MBA Healthcare, and Professional MBA Online. The MBA Full-Time Cohort begins a new class each fall and requires a two-week boot camp directly preceding the start of the semester. The Professional MBA Evening Cohort also requires a one-day orientation. At the option of the student, a concentration may be developed by taking a set of electives related to an area of interest. NOTE: The Executive Education area of the offers several distinctive and separate MBA programs, which retain the same set of MBA core courses but have their own set of specific topical electives. These include the Executive MBA (EMBA), the Global Leadership MBA (GLEMBA), the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Project Management, the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Product Lifecycle and Supply Chain Management, and the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Healthcare Leadership and Management. To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). In order to graduate, students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in the core GPA, degree GPA (exclusive of prerequisite courses), and cumulative GPA (all courses taken at the graduate level).

In addition, knowledge of calculus is required and students who have not completed an undergraduate calculus course may satisfy the prerequisite by completing OPRE 6303 Quantitative Foundations of Business. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites, however, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). All program prerequisites must be satisfied within the first semester of graduate study as a degree-seeking student. Course Requirements Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours Students must satisfactorily complete the following core courses. MIS 6324 Business Analytics with SAS or MIS 6356 Business Analytics with R MIS 6320 Database Foundations or BUAN 6320 Database Foundations for Business Analytics OPRE 6301 Statistics and Data Analysis OPRE 6332 Spreadsheet Modeling and Analytics NOTE: Students pursuing Business Analytics concentration must choose BUAN 6320 instead of MIS 6320. Elective Courses: 24 semester credit hours As a highly flexible program, students may customize and choose their own course of study by selecting a variety of master's-level courses from any unrestricted course/prefix or Subject/Courses year offered within JSOM to satisfy the elective requirements. Students are encouraged to focus in a concentration (optional) to obtain an in-depth knowledge in a specific business area depending on their interests. The following elective is a mandatory program requirement. Required Electives MAS 6009 Management Internship1 Concentrations Accounting: In today's global and technology-driven environment, managers need skills to effectively analyze accounting information and make value-enhancing decisions. Students may select accounting courses to concentrate in financial analysis, consulting, corporate governance and tax management. This concentration can be further refined to the areas of assurance services, taxation, and internal audit. Business Analytics: A concentration in business analytics covers statistics and econometrics, predictive modeling, decision and optimization (prescriptive) modeling, and data management. Students are prepared for a position within marketing analytics, decision and operations analytics, financial analytics, healthcare analytics, and IT analytics. Energy Management: The energy management concentration will provide students with skills critical to managerial decision making within energy companies, focusing on supply chain, operations, finance, and risk management. Finance: Students can prepare for careers in corporate finance, investment management, or the management of financial institutions. Courses in this area emphasize creative solutions to business financing problems, the development of value maximizing investment and financing strategies, and the analysis and management of fixed income and equity investments. Students may choose to concentrate in either corporate financial planning or the analysis of financial securities and investment portfolios. Healthcare Management: The primary goal of this concentration is to prepare students for leadership positions in healthcare organizations. The healthcare concentration is cross-functional and industry focused. Courses include cases, projects and assignments that are centered on applying management skills to healthcare issues and organizations. Classes are taught by faculty and healthcare executives who bring special expertise and experience to the program. Information Technology Management: Information technology is integral to all business operations and permeates all aspects of modern business and our courses will enable students to fully utilize information technology to solve business problems and gain strategic advantage. Advanced courses provide skills necessary for the \"supply\" side of information technology for IT consulting, software management and e-business. Innovation and Entrepreneurship: The concentration in innovation and entrepreneurship prepares students for successful business careers in entrepreneurial new ventures, entrepreneurial finance (venture capital/private equity), or innovation-related roles in mature organizations (product planning, product marketing, product development, more). The concentration allows students to pursue electives in either the new venture focus area or the innovation within the corporation focus area. Internal Audit: Today's job market for individuals in internal audit and risk management is exceptional. A concentration in this area covers internal audit from a broad perspective and addresses review of business processes, technology, governance, ethics, risk assessment and auditing standards, which allows individual to work in any industry or discipline. International Management: In today's global economy, there is a need to develop skills in various international business environments. Students can take a multidisciplinary approach to study international management, with courses in finance, marketing, strategic management, and legal and cross-cultural management. These integrate concepts and theories with international policies and business practices and prepare students to succeed in developing successful international ventures. Leadership in Organizations: The leadership concentration prepares students for management positions through the study of the psychological, sociological and organizational behavior disciplines. The program provides a foundation of leadership theory, building and problem solving in interpersonal work relationships, group dynamics, organizational decision-making and change and ethics. Marketing: Students learn to understand customers' needs and purchase behaviors, how to satisfy those needs, and how to make a profit in competitive industries and markets. Topics include developing an effective marketing strategy, developing new products and managing different brands, and product categories. Students can also acquire expertise in pricing, advertising and promotions, market research, and retailing strategies. Real Estate: The real estate concentration will provide students with both a practical and educational basis to become skilled decision-makers within the industry. This concentration includes courses in real estate finance and capital markets, covering real estate loans, syndication, securitization, regulation, investment and analysis, combining lectures and case studies to explore the sources of real estate value, project feasibility, strategies for financing, and portfolio management while covering market analysis, government approvals, financing and risk assessment. Strategic Management: This concentration focuses on corporate level strategic management, including implementation of strategic designs, top management team leadership, the strategic implications of the social, governmental, technological, and international environments, organization structuring, and strategic alliances. Students will learn how to integrate accounting, finance, economics and organization theory to create sustainable competitive advantage. Supply Chain Management: Students specializing in supply chain management gain an analytical understanding of how to leverage profits by continuously improving business processes. Effective integration of customers, suppliers, factories and stores through the coordination of various functional areas (marketing, finance, procurement) is an important theme. The area emphasizes using incentives, contracts and information technologies to foster efficiency and success. Systems Engineering and Management: The concentration is designed to meet the need for formalized education in design, engineering and management of complex systems involving a large number of interconnected components. It will develop a broad range of engineering and managerial skills that trains students to be managers of large projects that require expertise in both technical and managerial disciplines. 1.

Ziegler @ziegler Overview This program is for individuals seeking the most advanced academic degree with an emphasis on International Management Studies (IMS). Housed in the Organizations, Strategy, and International Management (OSIM) Area, this program is designed to prepare graduates to assume business school faculty positions in universities. Students may enter the IMS doctoral program after previous graduate training or directly from undergraduate programs. Desirable educational backgrounds include graduate training in any area of business administration, and graduate or undergraduate degrees in areas such as business administration, economics, sociology, political science, mathematics, and engineering, although students from other areas are also considered. All students must take PhD courses that are offered in each of the first two years in the program. Students must satisfy a first-year research paper requirement which will be due at the end of the first year (also known as the preliminary exam). Students also must pass the qualifying (comprehensive in nature) examination, which is administered at the end of the second year of study when all the relevant course requirements have been satisfied. The qualifying examination is intended to assess the student's mastery of the basic theories and methodologies central to the program and to evaluate the student's potential to do original research in an area of specialization. In addition, students must write research papers at the end of their second year. The first and second year papers should be based on two different research projects. All tenure-track and tenured faculty will be involved in evaluating these papers. Students will not be allowed to continue in the program should they fail to pass these evaluations. After passing the qualifying exam and the second-year paper, each student writes a dissertation proposal, which is defended before a faculty committee appointed in consultation with the dissertation chair. This committee also serves as the supervising committee for the dissertation after the proposal is approved.

Core and elective courses provide the students with a thorough understanding of management principles. Coursework incorporates a broad business outlook into the study of theory and practice. A sequence of PhD seminars exposes students to traditional and emerging research issues. Students have the opportunity to be involved in ongoing research projects under the mentorship of experienced faculty. We emphasize involving students in research early in their graduate careers. The close interaction with faculty members enables students to learn to identify and develop research ideas and create their own research agenda. Students also develop their teaching competence under faculty mentorship by teaching organized classes. The course of study for the PhD in Management Science consists of three phases. First is attaining a background in business concepts. Second is satisfying the requirements for doctoral proficiency. Third is the dissertation. Each area of study - Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, and Operations Management - determines the specific requirements for the three phases. Details can be obtained from the Director of the PhD programs in the Jindal School of Management. Incoming students complete a two-week math refresher before classes begin in August in preparation for fall classes. Students admitted into the program typically devote two years to the doctoral proficiency coursework and research projects. PhD students take a written preliminary exam at the end of their first year in the program over a set of core methodology courses. They then take a qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam that they must pass before admission for candidacy for the doctorate degree. After passing the qualifying exam, each student develops his or her dissertation research area, which is usually completed over the next two years. Doctoral proficiency encompasses courses in research methods, electives or a specialization, doctoral seminars, and a written and oral qualifying examination. Course Requirements Required core courses: 18 semester credit hours BPS 7303 Doctoral Teaching and Writing Seminar MAS 8V00 Special Topics in Management Science [Teaching Practicum] MECO 6345 Advanced Managerial Economics MECO 6350 Game Theory MECO 7312 Advanced Statistics and Probability (or a similar course such as STAT 5352) OPRE 7353 Optimization Secondary Required Core Courses: minimum of 9 semester credit hours MECO 6320 Econometrics (or ECON 6309 Econometrics I) MECO 6360 Topics in Industrial Organization MECO 7311 Advanced Game Theory MECO 7313 Applied Econometrics MECO 7320 Advanced Econometrics (or ECON 7309 Econometrics II) OPRE 7310 Probability and Stochastic Processes OPRE 7311 Stochastic Models in Operations Research OPRE 7320 Optimal Control Theory and Applications OPRE 7330 Deterministic Models in Operations Research Remaining requirements beyond the core consist of research courses, electives, independent study and seminars as approved by the program committee appointed to guide and evaluate each student. After completion of the coursework to achieve doctoral proficiency and passing the preliminary exam, the student will take a written qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam which must be passed before formal admission to candidacy for the doctorate. The student must also orally defend the dissertation proposal before starting the dissertation. Written examination in the area of specialization may also be required. The focal point of the PhD program is the dissertation. The dissertation is written under the direction of the candidate's committee. Twelve to 24 semester credit hours may be granted for the dissertation toward the minimum 75 semester credit hour requirement for the degree. At a time mutually agreeable with the candidate and the members of the committee, the student will orally defend his or her dissertation to the satisfaction of the committee. A student must pass in order to have the PhD degree conferred. Accounting Concentration This program is for individuals seeking training in the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of accounting. It is designed to prepare them primarily for teaching positions in research- oriented universities. Some students may be placed in senior positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations. The program requires hands-on training in accounting research, supported by work in the disciplines of economics, mathematics, psychology and statistics, culminating in a doctoral dissertation. Finance Concentration This program is for individuals seeking the most advanced academic degree with an emphasis in finance. It is designed to prepare them for (1) teaching positions in research-oriented universities, (2) senior staff positions in industry or government, or (3) senior positions in consulting organizations. However, the emphasis is on (1). The program consists of coursework in financial management, investments, and money and capital markets, together with work in the supporting areas of economics, mathematics and statistics; it culminates in a doctoral dissertation. Information Systems Concentration This program is designed for individuals who seek training in advanced theoretical and applied issues in the field of information systems. The training prepares students for conducting leading-edge research in topics ranging from the design of optimized systems to the effective use of such systems in organizations. Students undergo rigorous training in research methodologies as well as in the design of information systems. The research conducted is often interdisciplinary in nature, and is characterized by strong analytical modeling of new and emerging issues in information technology creation and management. The program prepares students mainly for academic positions in research universities. Some students may be placed in research positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations. Marketing Concentration The purpose of the PhD Program in Management Science with a marketing concentration is to train researchers capable of dealing with the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of marketing. Universities as well as major companies with marketing orientation aggressively recruit PhDs with strong theoretical and research training in marketing. Graduates will have rigorous training in disciplinary areas and research methodology. They will have knowledge of the various research streams in marketing, will have developed a research specialization and a clear perspective on management issues. Operations Management Concentration Operations Management emphasizes the development of models, methods, applications and algorithms as they apply to problems in manufacturing and services. All students will be exposed to deterministic and stochastic modeling and will have the option of applying and/or developing these and new methods to solve problems in their selected topics. The goal of the doctoral program in Operations Management is to educate future practitioners and researchers in the concepts and analytical techniques needed to understand and advance scientific solutions to the problems currently faced by operations managers. Research The faculty of the school makes intellectual contributions in two areas: fundamental scholarship that advances theory and practice, and applied scholarship that focuses on practical issues. The fundamental work includes traditional basic research as well as applied research that defines new areas of practice and provides general frameworks that address a wide range of application problems. The applied scholarship provides \"how-to\" frameworks for skilled practitioners, uses demonstration cases to show how theories can be applied, and defines new areas of application for existing tools and techniques.

Students also develop their teaching competence under faculty mentorship by teaching organized classes. The course of study for the PhD in Management Science consists of three phases. First is attaining a background in business concepts. Second is satisfying the requirements for doctoral proficiency. Third is the dissertation. Each area of study - Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, and Operations Management - determines the specific requirements for the three phases. Details can be obtained from the Director of the PhD programs in the Jindal School of Management. Incoming students complete a two-week math refresher before classes begin in August in preparation for fall classes. Students admitted into the program typically devote two years to the doctoral proficiency coursework and research projects. PhD students take a written preliminary exam at the end of their first year in the program over a set of core methodology courses. They then take a qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam that they must pass before admission for candidacy for the doctorate degree. After passing the qualifying exam, each student develops his or her dissertation research area, which is usually completed over the next two years. Doctoral proficiency encompasses courses in research methods, electives or a specialization, doctoral seminars, and a written and oral qualifying examination. Course Requirements Required core courses: 18 semester credit hours BPS 7303 Doctoral Teaching and Writing Seminar MAS 8V00 Special Topics in Management Science [Teaching Practicum] MECO 6345 Advanced Managerial Economics MECO 6350 Game Theory MECO 7312 Advanced Statistics and Probability (or a similar course such as STAT 5352) OPRE 7353 Optimization Secondary Required Core Courses: minimum of 9 semester credit hours MECO 6320 Econometrics (or ECON 6309 Econometrics I) MECO 6360 Topics in Industrial Organization MECO 7311 Advanced Game Theory MECO 7313 Applied Econometrics MECO 7320 Advanced Econometrics (or ECON 7309 Econometrics II) OPRE 7310 Probability and Stochastic Processes OPRE 7311 Stochastic Models in Operations Research OPRE 7320 Optimal Control Theory and Applications OPRE 7330 Deterministic Models in Operations Research Remaining requirements beyond the core consist of research courses, electives, independent study and seminars as approved by the program committee appointed to guide and evaluate each student. After completion of the coursework to achieve doctoral proficiency and passing the preliminary exam, the student will take a written qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam which must be passed before formal admission to candidacy for the doctorate. The student must also orally defend the dissertation proposal before starting the dissertation. Written examination in the area of specialization may also be required. The focal point of the PhD program is the dissertation. The dissertation is written under the direction of the candidate's committee. Twelve to 24 semester credit hours may be granted for the dissertation toward the minimum 75 semester credit hour requirement for the degree. At a time mutually agreeable with the candidate and the members of the committee, the student will orally defend his or her dissertation to the satisfaction of the committee. A student must pass in order to have the PhD degree conferred. Accounting Concentration This program is for individuals seeking training in the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of accounting. It is designed to prepare them primarily for teaching positions in research- oriented universities. Some students may be placed in senior positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations. The program requires hands-on training in accounting research, supported by work in the disciplines of economics, mathematics, psychology and statistics, culminating in a doctoral dissertation. Finance Concentration This program is for individuals seeking the most advanced academic degree with an emphasis in finance. It is designed to prepare them for (1) teaching positions in research-oriented universities, (2) senior staff positions in industry or government, or (3) senior positions in consulting organizations. However, the emphasis is on (1). The program consists of coursework in financial management, investments, and money and capital markets, together with work in the supporting areas of economics, mathematics and statistics; it culminates in a doctoral dissertation. Information Systems Concentration This program is designed for individuals who seek training in advanced theoretical and applied issues in the field of information systems. The training prepares students for conducting leading-edge research in topics ranging from the design of optimized systems to the effective use of such systems in organizations. Students undergo rigorous training in research methodologies as well as in the design of information systems. The research conducted is often interdisciplinary in nature, and is characterized by strong analytical modeling of new and emerging issues in information technology creation and management. The program prepares students mainly for academic positions in research universities. Some students may be placed in research positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations. Marketing Concentration The purpose of the PhD Program in Management Science with a marketing concentration is to train researchers capable of dealing with the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of marketing. Universities as well as major companies with marketing orientation aggressively recruit PhDs with strong theoretical and research training in marketing. Graduates will have rigorous training in disciplinary areas and research methodology. They will have knowledge of the various research streams in marketing, will have developed a research specialization and a clear perspective on management issues. Operations Management Concentration Operations Management emphasizes the development of models, methods, applications and algorithms as they apply to problems in manufacturing and services. All students will be exposed to deterministic and stochastic modeling and will have the option of applying and/or developing these and new methods to solve problems in their selected topics. The goal of the doctoral program in Operations Management is to educate future practitioners and researchers in the concepts and analytical techniques needed to understand and advance scientific solutions to the problems currently faced by operations managers. Research The faculty of the school makes intellectual contributions in two areas: fundamental scholarship that advances theory and practice, and applied scholarship that focuses on practical issues. The fundamental work includes traditional basic research as well as applied research that defines new areas of practice and provides general frameworks that address a wide range of application problems. The applied scholarship provides \"how-to\" frameworks for skilled practitioners, uses demonstration cases to show how theories can be applied, and defines new areas of application for existing tools and techniques.

Specific admission requirements for the Executive MS- SEM follow. A student entering the MS-SEM program (Executive Education Master's) should meet the following guidelines: A minimum of a BS in engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics or finance (specifically, programs that provide adequate fundamental skills in mathematics). A minimum of three years of work experience. Submission of three letters of recommendation from individuals who are able to judge the candidate's probability of success in pursuing a program of study leading to the MS-SEM degree. Submission of an essay outlining the candidate's background, education, and professional goals. Degree Requirements The MS-SEM program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time MS-SEM students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time. The MS-SEM degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the non-thesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36 semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the MS-SEM degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate Subject/Courses. This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the MS-SEM degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements). An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the MS-SEM degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis. Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor. Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an MS-SEM degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester. Course Requirements Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the eight courses listed below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree. Engineering Core Courses Choose two courses from the following: SYSM 6301 Systems Engineering, Architecture and Design SYSM 6302 Dynamics of Complex Networks and Systems SYSM 6303 Statistics and Data Analysis SYSM 6305 Optimization Theory and Practice Management Core Courses Choose two courses from the following: SYSM 6311 Systems Project Management in Engineering and Operations SYSM 6318 Marketing Management SYSM 6333 Systems Organizational Behavior SYSM 6337 Accounting for Managers Prescribed Electives: 12 semester credit hours Students are required to take an additional four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the set of eight core courses listed above and/or the set of courses listed below. Two of these courses must be chosen from the two Engineering sections (core and elective), and two from the two Management sections (core and elective). Because a program objective is to maintain a high degree of flexibility, students are encouraged to work with an MS-SEM program advisor to discuss possible (limited) exceptions and substitutions for the prescribed elective courses.

Spong 0, Steve Yurkovich 0Assistant Professor: Justin Ruths 0Professor Emeritus: Mathukumalli Vidyasagar 0Senior Lecturer: Nhut Nguyen @nhutnn Admission Requirements A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses must complete prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor. Specific admission requirements for the Executive MS- SEM follow. A student entering the MS-SEM program (Executive Education Master's) should meet the following guidelines: A minimum of a BS in engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics or finance (specifically, programs that provide adequate fundamental skills in mathematics). A minimum of three years of work experience. Submission of three letters of recommendation from individuals who are able to judge the candidate's probability of success in pursuing a program of study leading to the MS-SEM degree. Submission of an essay outlining the candidate's background, education, and professional goals. Degree Requirements The MS-SEM program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time MS-SEM students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time. The MS-SEM degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the non-thesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36 semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the MS-SEM degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate Subject/Courses. This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the MS-SEM degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements). An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the MS-SEM degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis. Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor. Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an MS-SEM degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester. Course Requirements Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the eight courses listed below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree. Engineering Core Courses Choose two courses from the following: SYSM 6301 Systems Engineering, Architecture and Design SYSM 6302 Dynamics of Complex Networks and Systems SYSM 6303 Statistics and Data Analysis SYSM 6305 Optimization Theory and Practice Management Core Courses Choose two courses from the following: SYSM 6311 Systems Project Management in Engineering and Operations SYSM 6318 Marketing Management SYSM 6333 Systems Organizational Behavior SYSM 6337 Accounting for Managers Prescribed Electives: 12 semester credit hours Students are required to take an additional four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the set of eight core courses listed above and/or the set of courses listed below. Two of these courses must be chosen from the two Engineering sections (core and elective), and two from the two Management sections (core and elective). Because a program objective is to maintain a high degree of flexibility, students are encouraged to work with an MS-SEM program advisor to discuss possible (limited) exceptions and substitutions for the prescribed elective courses.

The concentration area consists of four courses (12 semester credit hours) in the degree program; examples include: Aerospace and Defense Systems; Business and Data Analytics; Control and Mechatronic Systems, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, Energy and Infrastructure Systems, Enterprise and Data Management Systems; Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management; Global Supply Chain Management; Healthcare Systems; Optimization and Operations Research; Telecom, IT and Multimedia Networks , and Transportation Systems. Finally, because of the flexible nature of the MS-SEM degree program, students may submit for approval a \"personalized\" concentration area that focuses on aspects of systems engineering, and may combine elements of other concentration areas on a focused theme. Certificate Programs in Systems Engineering and Management The MS-SEM program offers two certificates: a Certificate in Systems Engineering and a Certificate in Systems Management, primarily intended for students who do not wish to pursue the complete MS degree. Each certificate requires 12 semester credit hours. See Course Descriptions for information on course content. These certificates allow students to fit their education into their busy schedules and pursue the track that best fits their career path. These flexible education programs provide students with outstanding opportunities to access UT Dallas' world-class faculty and hands-on learning experiences.

    "text": "Registration and Enrollment Requirements - - 2022 Undergraduate Catalog2021 Undergraduate Catalog2020 Undergraduate Catalog2019 Undergraduate Catalog2018 Undergraduate Catalog2017 Undergraduate Catalog2016 Undergraduate Subject/Courses 2022 Graduate Catalog2021 Graduate Catalog2020 Graduate Catalog2019 Graduate Catalog2018 Graduate Catalog2017 Graduate Catalog2016 Graduate Subject/Courses Graduate Policies and Procedures Registration and Enrollment Requirements Following the receipt of your admission letter, per State legislation effective January 1, 2012, all entering Texas college students must receive a vaccination or booster (if the vaccination is five years old) against bacterial meningitis before enrollment in accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 51.9192. Entering students who are 22 years of age or older are exempt. Questions concerning the bacterial meningitis requirement and forms should be directed to the Office of the Registrar, 972-883-2342 or go to www.utdallas.edu/registrar. A graduate student must be registered in any session: during which they are taking courses, or taking examinations, required in his/her degree program. in which he/she requires guidance in the preparation of a thesis or dissertation required in his/her degree program. for at least one semester credit hour in the semester in which they plan to graduate, unless they have submitted a final approved dissertation/thesis to the Office of Graduate Education before the priority deadline published by the Office of Graduate Education. Graduating students may avail themselves of this rule only one time. Some programs may require additional semester credit hours in the semester a student plans to graduate. have paid all required fees in the semester in which he/she plans to graduate. Priority deadline submissions require a nonrefundable/nontransferable fee. Orientation New student orientation sessions are designed to assist new students with an understanding of university rules and regulations and to provide information about registration procedures, academic programs, and student life. New student orientation programs are available for UT Dallas freshmen, undergraduate transfer students, graduate students, international students, and teaching and research assistants. Attendance is strongly recommended for all new students as a means of efficient matriculation into the University. International Student Orientation is mandatory for all F and J status international students. TA and RA orientation is mandatory for all newly appointed Teaching and Research Assistants. Academic Good Standing Registration in the graduate programs beyond the first semester (or summer session) is contingent on the student's being in good academic standing based on three main factors: Satisfactory progress in meeting admission conditions that were imposed at the time of admission. Maintenance of a minimum 3.00 cumulative grade point average (GPA) in graduate courses. Students changing graduate programs may petition the Graduate Dean if their cumulative grade point average is below a 3.00. Satisfactory progress in meeting program degree requirements. If, at the end of a semester, a student's cumulative GPA is below 3.00, the student will be placed on academic probation. The student must earn sufficient grade points during the next two semesters of registration to raise the cumulative GPA to at least 3.00 exclusive of incomplete (I) grades. Failure to achieve this 3.00 cumulative GPA will result in immediate dismissal from the University. A student must have a GPA of at least 3.00 to be eligible to graduate with a master's or doctoral degree. Continuous Enrollment Unless on an approved leave of absence, a graduate student in a degree program must maintain continuous enrollment during the fall and spring (long session) semesters of each academic year. A graduate student who fails to register in any given long session will be permitted to re-enroll through his/her program office in any two subsequent semesters provided the student was in good academic standing at the time of last enrollment. A continuing student in good academic standing may register in one of three ways: online, with the department or program office, with the Office of the Registrar during registration, or early to increase the probability of enrollment in available courses. The Office of the Registrar informs the instructor of the names of all students who are officially registered and have paid all required tuition and fees in each class. It is recommended that the student confirm with the instructor that his/her registration has been properly recorded within the first week of classes. It is the student's responsibility during his/her enrolled semester that he/she is attending the correct courses for which he/she is registered. Students are not permitted to sit in classes without being officially enrolled or auditing the course. Dates of Early, Regular and Late Registration Registration dates and procedures are listed in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar. These online resources contains important dates and information that will be useful throughout the semester. Failure to consult and be aware of these dates and procedures does not excuse a student from information or regulations contained therein. The University reserves the right to make changes to both calendars at any time. Schedule Changes: Dropping, Adding and Withdrawing From Courses Dates and time limits for schedule changes can be found in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar. All dates and formal procedures for registration and late registration are listed at www.utdallas.edu/registrar/registration. A new student seeking to drop or add courses to his/her schedule must obtain permission from his/her graduate advisor in the degree program. Drop/Add forms may be obtained from advising offices. Drop/Adds may not be processed after Census Day. Any drops prior to and including Census Day will not show on the student's transcript. Withdrawals after Census Day will show as a W (withdraw) on the transcript. After the last day indicated in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar for a graduate student to withdraw, the course withdrawal will be approved only on a documented emergency basis for reasons extrinsic to curricula matters. To secure such approval, the student must complete a Drop/Add form and obtain the signature of the instructor certifying that the student was passing at the time of the proposed withdrawal. The student should then submit the Drop/Add form and a written petition detailing the nature of the emergency with written documentation from employer or doctor, as appropriate, to the graduate advisor and then to the Dean of Graduate Studies. If the petition is approved, the grade assigned by the instructor on the Drop/Add form will determine the grade which will appear on the student's transcript: a passing grade will appear as a W on the transcript; a failing grade will appear as an F. Students who cease to attend classes without securing approval in the manner prescribed above will receive the grade of F for that course. Courses may not be dropped after the last day of classes in the semester. A student who habitually withdraws from a significant fraction of his/her schedules may lose the right to withdraw or may be dismissed from the University for failure to make adequate academic progress. Any student on a Teaching/Research Assistantship wishing to drop a course at any time during the semester must secure the signature of the academic dean of his/her school and the Dean of Graduate Education. The Office of the Registrar, upon recommendation of the instructor and with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education, may require a student to drop a course for which the student has not satisfied the prerequisite. UT Dallas operates multiple sessions with different academic calendar and Census dates. If a student registers in a shorter session, it is the student's responsibility to review the online Comet Calendar deadlines that affect the drop/add/withdrawal procedures. The same holds true for the summer session. Paying Fees as a Part of Registration A student is not registered or eligible to attend classes until all tuition and fees have been paid in full or until the student has arranged installment payments with the Bursar by the payment deadline in the online Comet Calendar or the Academic Calendar. If a student's registration has been canceled for nonpayment, a reinstatement fee and a late fee will be charged (see online course schedule for current fees). A student who has not completed the payment of all tuition and fees by the end of the semester will be subject to one or more of the following actions at the University's option: bar against readmission at this institution, withholding of grades, degree and official transcript, all penalties and actions authorized by law. Leave of Absence A request for a leave of absence must be made through the academic department or program to the Dean of Graduate Education and is recorded on the student's academic record by the Office of the Registrar. A leave of absence will not be approved for more than one academic year. Exceptions may be approved by the Associate Graduate Dean of the academic department. The leave of absence does not alter the time limits placed on graduate degrees. At the end of an approved leave of absence period, the student will be automatically reinstated to an active student status and will be exempt from the readmission requirements. Withdrawal (Resignation) from the University A student who wishes to withdraw entirely from the University must complete the proper withdrawal form and procedures in the Office of the Registrar. The grade assigned by the instructor on the withdrawal form will determine the grade which will appear on the student's transcript: a passing grade will appear as a W on the transcript a failing grade will appear as an F Withdrawal after the final drop date requires the same procedures as listed in the previous section on Schedule Changes. Re-Entry or Reapplication Re-Entry Students who were in good academic standing when last enrolled, may be eligible to re-enter their academic degree program, under their original Subject/Courses without reapplying through the Office of Admission. The following guidelines describe when a student may submit a re-entry form: A previous graduate degree-seeking, returning as graduate degree-seeking who is returning to the same program and same plan, and who was in academic good standing. A previous graduate degree-seeking, returning as graduate non-degree seeking who was in good academic standing. A previous graduate taking undergraduate courses (GRU), coming back as graduate taking undergraduate courses (GRU) who was in good academic standing. A masters student must be returning within six years of the initial admission term. For example, a student admitted in fall 2017 must return and complete their degree prior to 2023. Within the six- year period, the student may reenter under the original Subject/Courses. A doctoral student must be returning within ten years of the initial admission term. For example, a student admitted in fall 2017 must return and complete their degree prior to 2027. Within the ten-year period, the student may reenter under the original Subject/Courses. Re-entry is not guaranteed and requires the approval of the department/program in their school before submitting the form to the Office of the Registrar. ReApplication Returning students who are not eligible to complete a re-entry form will be required to re-apply to the program of their intended degree. The returning student's new application will be reviewed according to current admissions standards. If accepted, the readmitted student will be bound by all conditions of the Subject/Courses in force at the time of readmission. The following guidelines describe a student who must reapply: A previous graduate degree-seeking, returning as graduate degree-seeking student if returning to a different program and/or a different plan. A previous graduate non-degree seeking student, returning as graduate degree-seeking student. Additional Requirements for Re-Entry or ReApplication Students who are granted re-admission (re-entry or through a new application) may be advised that some prior coursework may not count toward their degree if it exceeds the time allowed for degree completion and is subject to the requirements set forth by legislative or regental action, and changes become effective on the date of enactment All returning students (through the re-entry process or the apply process) are required to submit official transcripts for all institutions of higher education he/she attended after leaving UT Dallas to the following address: The Office of Registrar The University of Texas at Dallas 800 West Campbell Road ROC 13 Richardson, TX 75080-3021 If official transcripts are not received by Census Day, the student will be automatically dropped from any currently enrolled courses. The readmitted student may be required to submit bacterial meningitis vaccination necessary forms before being allowed to register.

Schools may have additional requirements for undergraduates to register for graduate courses. If approved, these graduate courses can be applied toward satisfying undergraduate degree requirements or can be designated for future application toward a graduate degree or certificate requirement at UT Dallas. The student must declare at the time of registration for the course, on a form provided by the Undergraduate Associate Dean, how each approved course is to be applied. Once applied, the options cannot be changed. An undergraduate student cannot take more than 15 graduate semester credit hours total. For example, if an undergraduate student chooses to take 9 graduate semester credit hours reserved for application toward graduate degree or certificate, the undergraduate student can take only 6 graduate semester credit hours toward the undergraduate degree (this includes graduate hours chosen towards the fast track option). Graduate Courses Applied Toward an Undergraduate Degree Up to 12 semester credit hours of graduate work taken as an undergraduate may be used for completing any baccalaureate degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Pass/Fail grading for graduate courses will be permitted only in this category but must be approved by the instructor prior to the start of class. Graduate Courses for Possible Future Use as Graduate Credit Undergraduates may take up to 12 semester credit hours of graduate courses to reserve for possible application toward a graduate degree or certificate. To register, undergraduate students must obtain permission from the course instructor and from the graduate advisor of the program in which the course is offered. Such courses may be eligible for application to the student's graduate record when the student is admitted to a graduate program. These courses will not apply to the student's undergraduate degree and will not affect the student's undergraduate GPA. These courses will apply to the student's graduate degree or certificate and will affect the student's graduate cumulative GPA.

There will be a set of required and elective courses that need to be taken as part of the major. Other courses may include preparatory or leveling courses. Three levels of degrees exist: (1) the undergraduate level (the baccalaureate or a bachelor's), (2) the master's level, and (3) the doctoral level. Each degree has a designation such as Arts, Science, or Philosophy, for example, a Bachelor's of Arts (BA), a Master of Science (MS) or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). A degree program comprises of all the above elements. In other words, a student will enroll in a major at a specific level, in order to earn a degree, such as, a Master of Science in Mathematics or a Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics. Official Transcripts The Office of the Registrar retains a listing of approved items recorded on the official transcript. The official academic transcript will list the degree, and if applicable, concentrations, designations, and certificates. Only concentrations whose requirements are published in the Subject/Courses will be identified on the transcript.

At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. All official student email correspondence will be sent only to a student's UT Dallas email address and UT Dallas will only consider email requests originating from an official UT Dallas student email account. This allows the University to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of each individual's corresponding via email and the security of the transmitted information. The University of Texas at Dallas furnishes each student with a free email account that is to be used in all communication with university personnel. The Department of Information Technology provides a method for students to have their UT Dallas mail forwarded to other email accounts. To activate a student UT Dallas computer account and forward email to another account, go to netid.utdallas.edu.

This includes Campus Alert E-mail, the University's website, campus and local media, text-messaging, Fire Alarm Systems, Indoor Warning System and Outdoor Warning System. For policies and procedures, and reporting requirements please visit www.utdallas.edu/ehs/. Fire Safety The entire UT Dallas campus fire alarm system is monitored 24-7 through a SimplexGrinnell Information management system. This IMS operates on a fiber optic loop connected to every building fire panel on the Richardson campus. All 52 of UT Dallas' buildings have primary reporting to the University Police and secondary reporting to EHS and EMS. For policies and procedures please visit www.utdallas.edu/ehs/programs/fire/. Gang-free Zones Premises owned, rented or leased by The University of Texas at Dallas, and areas within 1,000 feet of the premises are \"gang-free\" zones. Certain criminal offenses, including those involving gang-related crimes, will be enhanced to the next highest category of offense if committed in a gang-free zone by an individual 17 years or older. See Texas Penal Code, Section 71.028. Missing Student Notification The purpose of the UT Dallas Missing Persons Policy is to establish procedures for the University's response to reports of missing students as required by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. This policy applies to students who reside in on-campus housing. For purposes of this policy, a student may be considered a \"missing person\" when he or she is absent from the University for more than 24 hours without any known reason. A student may also be deemed missing when his/her absence is contrary to his/her usual pattern of behavior and/or unusual circumstances may have caused the absence. Such circumstances could include, but not be limited to, a report or suspicion that the missing person may be the victim of foul play, has expressed suicidal thoughts, is drug dependent, or has been with persons who may endanger the student's welfare. All residential students will have the opportunity to designate a confidential contact to be notified by the University no more than 24 hours after the student is determined missing. Instructions will be provided on how to register that person's contact information. Residential students' contact information will be registered confidentially, will be accessible only to authorized UT Dallas officials, and may not be disclosed except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation. All reports of missing students must be directed to the UT Dallas Police Department, which shall investigate each report and make a determination about whether the student is missing. In addition, no later than 24 hours after a student is determined missing, UT Dallas will notify the Richardson Police Department, unless the Richardson Police Department was the entity that determined the student to be missing. At that time, if the missing student is under the age of 18 and not emancipated, UT Dallas will also notify the student's custodial parent or guardian.

The law applies to those institutions that regularly receive federal funding from the Department of Education and is enforced by the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA defines an eligible student as a student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education. Students have four primary rights under FERPA: To inspect and review their education records To seek to amend those education records they believe to be inaccurate or misleading To have some control over the disclosure of information from those education records To file a complaint concerning alleged failures by an institution to comply with FERPA regulations within 180 days Complaints of alleged violations may be addressed to Office of the Chief Privacy Officer U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington, D.C. 20202-5920 The UT Dallas FERPA violation link is located at www.utdallas.edu/ferpa. The student's education record is established and maintained to provide both the student and the University with information regarding the student's progress while enrolled at the University. Any student enrolled in the University has access to and may inspect those records relating to his or her academic progress, to the extent allowed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the Texas Public Information Act. The record is considered to be confidential and may be released only within the limitations clearly defined by university regulations and state and federal statutes or with the student's written permission. The student's education record contains both directory and non-directory information. Directory or public information is information that is not generally considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released. A student may choose to withhold release of directory information. A student may do so by following the FERPA - Request for Confidentiality instructions available at www.utdallas.edu/registrar/forms. FERPA does not extend to research papers and theses authored by students; these documents are available to interested members of the public. Detailed information pertaining to the content of and handling of students' education records is contained in University policy Handbook of Operating Procedures, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (UTDSP5010). Students wishing more information about their rights established under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act should contact the Office of the Registrar, Student Services Building, (972) 883-2342 or visit www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa.

Students are encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment. Excused students will be allowed to take missed exams or complete assignments within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment. If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the President of UT Dallas or from the President's designee. The chief executive officer or designee must take into account the legislative intent of Texas Education Code 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the chief executive officer or designee.

Before traveling, it is beneficial to review the travel policy about domestic and foreign travel, emergency procedures, insurance, and liability; and to obtain authorization by completing travel authorization forms and other related forms at least 5 working days prior to travel. Procedures also apply to faculty, staff, and students who transport students off campus on any university-organized and university-sponsored travel business or related travel activities for student organizations. Student Travel to International Locations Students representing UT Dallas through participation in a UT Dallas Education Abroad program, or for international events such as conferences, workshops, or sports competitions, are required to complete international travel procedures, including trip registration, and to receive institutional travel authorization prior to departure. Travel to high risk regions requires review and authorization through the UT Dallas International Oversight Committee (IOC). Students that have obtained institutional travel authorization are enrolled in the International Travel Insurance Plan. Enrollment in this insurance program is mandatory, regardless of any other insurance the students may have, including insurance possibly required by an affiliate study abroad program or a foreign government. Students traveling abroad for an approved Education Abroad program, must also complete the Education Abroad Application process prior to departure. Detailed information regarding this policy, in accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 51.950, can be accessed at the UT Dallas Policy Navigator, policy.utdallas.edu/utdbp3023, and at www.utdallas.edu/administration/insurance/travel.

    "title": "Dr. Hasan Pirkul – Endowed Chairs and Professorships",
    "text": "The Hillcrest Foundation, founded by Mrs. W. W. Caruth, Sr., created the chair in December 1988 to honor the Caruth family by supporting a distinguished professor with a national or international reputation to deliver superior educational guidance for future leaders of the state. Pirkul assumed the chair in September 1996. “The message that investiture sends to the University community as well as the outside community is that UT Dallas not only places a high value on research accomplishments, but also that UT Dallas is here to compete with the best universities in the U.S. with substantial numbers of distinguished professorships and chairs. We have the means of attracting the very best faculty out there and retaining them.” Since 1996, Dr. Hasan Pirkul has led the Naveen Jindal School of Management through tremendous growth to increasing stature. He oversaw the construction of the school’s $38 million facility, which was completed in 2003. Ten years later, he helped direct the building of a $25 million addition that provides 50 percent more space for the University’s largest school. “The new addition has provided us both breathing room and vital space,” he said. “While it includes many new classrooms, labs and a spacious Career Management Center, it also gives students many areas to congregate and work together. That enhances their social as well as educational well-being, and it contributes favorably to how they view the school.” Pirkul has transformed the School of Management. Student enrollment has soared from 2,252 in 1996 to more than 9,000 in fall 2016. The faculty is six times larger, increasing from 45 to more than 280, with more than 20 named professorships. Since 1996, the number of academic programs has risen from six degrees to more than 20. In 2011, the school was named the Naveen Jindal School of Management in honor of a gift donated by alumnus Naveen Jindal MBA’92, who is chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd. in India. Pirkul has created an academic environment that fosters scholarly inquiry, innovative teaching and research productivity. Under his leadership, the school’s academic programs are continually ranked in The Princeton Review, Bloomberg Businessweek and U.S. News & World Report. Pirkul helped create the UT Dallas Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™, a widely used measure that he believes is his best contribution to research. The index serves as a benchmark of faculty research output in leading peer-reviewed journals and currently ranks the Jindal School fifth both in North America and globally. “The UTD Top 100 has helped us set and reach our goal of having the Jindal School become ever more productive in research,” he said. “Improving our standing makes recruiting of faculty, students and businesses to the region much easier.” As a teacher, Pirkul said he’s proud of advising 16 PhD students, many of whom have gone on to become successful academics. His research interests include design of telecommunication networks, distributed computer system design, knowledge-based systems, locating facilities, neural networks and genetic algorithms. He is the founding co-editor-in-chief of the Journal of Information Technology and Management. He has served as an associate editor of Management Science, Operations Research and Journal of Database Management. He received a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering from Bogazici University in Turkey. He earned his master’s in management science and PhD in computer information systems at the Simon School, University of Rochester. Before joining UT Dallas in 1996, he taught at The Ohio State University from 1981 to 1996. Endowed Chairs and Professorships 800 W.

Empirically, I use quantitative abductive methods and situate my studies in the contexts of the opioid crisis and creation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Currently, my empirical research examines how different types of organizations engage in scientific discourse to influence regulatory policy. I consider engagement in scientific discourse to be efforts to shape scientists' beliefs on answers to scientific questions. Using nearly 30,000 public comments submitted during the creation of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, I explore both who attempts to influence regulatory policy (e.g. firms, trade associations, non-profits) and how (e.g. engagement in scientific discourse versus lobbying, contributions to scientific discourse possessing versus lacking scientific merit). My theoretical research broadens this scope to consider when and how firms engage with empirical evidence to influence stakeholders’ perceptions of issues and resist making substantive concessions to stakeholders. 800 W Campbell Road, Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705"

Ali assumed the position in September 2006. “It has been wonderful to be a part of this institution during its amazing growth both in size and stature.” As a scholar of financial accounting, Dr. Ashiq Ali says the subject plays an important role in the proper functioning of capital markets. Referring to the recent events in the financial world, he notes: “The importance of this role is underscored by many landmark events of the last two decades, including the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom, the U.S. stock market’s dot-com bubble, and the subprime mortgage crisis,” he said. “These events led to important regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.” His research examines the causes and consequences of these events and regulations. Specifically, he has studied the effect of corporate governance and other firm characteristics on corporate disclosure policies and financial transparency, as well as whether recent financial regulations have been beneficial to shareholders. His research has also dealt with the capital market’s efficiency in the valuation of securities. His work has been published in The Accounting Review, Journal of Accounting and Economics, Journal of Accounting Research, Journal of Financial Economics, and Review of Financial Studies. He is an editorial board member of The Accounting Review and the Journal of Accounting, Auditing, and Finance.

It’s not the only risky business. Finance is a risky business. Drilling oil is a risky business. Nuclear plants are risky. Risk is a part of our lives, and it’s something to consider with attention.” Since joining UT Dallas in 2004, Dr. Alain Bensoussan has been devoted to developing risk and decision analysis into a scientific field. He became interested in studying risk after his experiences in the space sector. The issue of risk is inherent in many areas, including engineering, finance, security or natural hazards. As such, Bensoussan is helping to build a new interdisciplinary science that can provide models and tools for a large variety of applications. “I wanted to devote my time to developing risk management as a scientific field because it is important to have in mind that risks, wherever they come from, have common features,” he said. “Therefore, I approach risks by finding concepts, methods and techniques which can apply in a similar way, whether it’s in finance, nuclear energy or any other domain.” He is head of UT Dallas’ International Center for Decision and Risk Analysis, which develops risk management research as it pertains to large-investment industrial projects that involve new technologies, applications and markets. The National Science Foundation, the state of Texas and European agencies support his research. He is the co-editor of Risk and Decision Analysis and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. He is also a Von Humboldt Research Award recipient. Bensoussan served as president of the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control. He is chair professor of Risk and Decision Analysis at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and World Class University Distinguished Professor at Ajou University. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Paris Dauphine. He earned a master’s degree in mathematics and sciences from Ecole Polytechnique, a master’s degree in economics and statistics from Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l’Administration Economique, and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Paris. Bensoussan was selected by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics to receive the 2014 W.T. and Ida Reid Prize for his contributions in the fields of differential equations and control theory. In 2013, he was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Bensoussan is intensifying his collaboration with the alternative energy industry in the domain of wind power forecasting.

As a teacher, I am most proud when an ex-student calls me to say they benefited from something they learned in my classroom.” In the 1970s, Dr. Gary Bolton was interested in economics because those problems dominated the news. He gravitated toward microeconomics, particularly decision-making, because he believed more should be known about how individuals respond to institutions and events. Bolton’s graduate school mentor, Dr. Alvin Roth, influenced his research, and he still uses research methods he learned from Roth, who is a professor at Stanford University. “He taught me game theory, which concerns itself with how people make decisions, especially when they interact with one another, and he also introduced me to experimental economics, which provides a way of testing the ideas we develop in game theory,” Bolton said. “It is a potent combination of theoretical and empirical tools.” Bolton’s research focuses on decision-making issues such as negotiation, reputation building, and bargaining and dispute resolution. He also performs research on economic design, which covers market trust systems and negotiation decision support. He joined the Naveen Jindal School of Management faculty in the summer of 2012 along with his wife, Dr. Elena Katok, who is an Ashbel Smith Professor. Bolton’s articles have been published in the American Economic Review, Management Science, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, Games and Economic Behavior and more. He was featured in a History Channel documentary titled, “Seven Deadly Sins: Greed.” He is also the associate editor of Experimental Economics. He recently co-edited The Oxford Handbook of Economic Conflict Resolution along with Dr. Rachel Croson, who is also a UT Dallas professor. He won the MBA Core Instructor Award four times at Pennsylvania State University where he taught before joining UT Dallas. He sits on the board of directors for the UT Dallas Negotiations Center. Bolton received his bachelor’s degree in economics and mathematics from Drew University, his master’s in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, and his PhD in economics from Carnegie Mellon University.

Enthoven, a longtime accounting professor at the Naveen Jindal School of Management, to support the research and scholarly activities of the chair holder. Cready assumed the position in July 2014. “I feel privileged that I’ve been recognized with such an honor. It’s something I really never would have expected when I started out on this career path.” Dr. William Cready became interested in examining investors’ trading responses to accounting information at The Ohio State University, where he was a doctoral student. During his doctoral program’s weekly workshop, several papers regarding trading volume were presented. The papers piqued his interest because he wanted to learn more about how different types of investors trade in similar or differing fashions. Since then, he has concentrated his research in this area and has published numerous articles in leading journals. Cready also studies how items are reported on income statements, particularly a classification known as “special items.” He has been involved in several studies that explored the implications of classifying these items on manager compensation and stock price valuation and whether the special items serve as vehicles for hiding more ordinary expenses. He also studies the relationship between aggregate earnings and stock market returns. Cready serves as the area coordinator for accounting in the Naveen Jindal School of Management. He is a certified public accountant and management accountant. Previously receiving the Ashbel Smith Professorship and his students’ achievements are among his career highlights. “The success of the students I’ve worked with has really been something I’m proud of,” he said. He is an editorial board member of The International Journal of Accounting, Contemporary Accounting Research, and The Accounting Review.

Cecil, Distinguished Scholar in Residence at UT Dallas, for 50 years of work in education and for his years of dedicated service at the Southwestern Legal Foundation and to the University. The chair supports an outstanding scholar who can perpetuate Dr. Cecil’s commitment to the examination and teaching of the basic principles of ethics. “I’ve been here almost 10 years, and I’ve been extremely impressed by the growth of the Naveen Jindal School of Management and the University. Given the increasing stature of a global nature of UT Dallas, it’s really a tremendous honor to be so recognized by my peers and the administration.” Dr. Gregory G. Dess is an internationally recognized expert on business management strategy. His primary research interests are strategic management, entrepreneurship and knowledge management. When he was a doctoral student at the University of Washington, strategic management piqued his interest because a key issue is discovering how firms create value. “I find that very interesting because it becomes multidisciplinary, so I think it has an integrative nature with a lot of theoretical issues, but it still has a real strong bottom line – how can we create value for the organization as well as, hopefully, a social good for society,” he said. This year, the Academy of Management Perspectives ranked Dess among the top 20 influential researchers in the field of management based on the publication’s study of scholarly impact. In 2008, the Journal of Management listed him among the top 50 scholars who have had the greatest impact on the field of management in the last quarter-century. His influential paper on entrepreneurship that earned Dess the Academy of Management Award explores relationships between a firm’s entrepreneurial behavior and its performance by detailing how certain dimensions combine with business practices to create high performance. The paper has been cited in more than 2,700 papers and journal articles since it was published in the Academy of Management Review. His career also includes being inducted as one of 33 charter members of the Academy of Management Journal’s Hall of Fame in 2000. He has co-authored several books and published numerous articles in leading academic journals. He currently serves on several editorial boards including Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal and Strategic Management Journal. Dess joined UT Dallas in 2002.

The topics of market design and strategic procurement naturally lend themselves to being investigated using game theoretic models and laboratory methods, so this was a natural fit.” Her husband, Dr. Gary Bolton, holds the O.P. Jindal Chair in Managerial Economics at UT Dallas. Dr. Alvin Roth is an economics professor at Stanford University. Katok and Bolton developed the Center and Lab for Behavioral Operations and Economics at UT Dallas for which they both serve as co-directors. Katok helped establish the Behavioral Operations Management section of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) and has served as president of the section. She co-organized the first Behavioral Research in Operations Management conference in 2006. The conferences are now held annually, which she said is a testament to the growth of behavioral operations management. Katok’s research has been published in top business and economics journals, including Management Science, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, and Production and Operations Management. She is currently department editor for behavioral operations for the journal Production and Operations Management and associate editor at Management Science. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense are among the organizations that have supported her research. Katok came to UT Dallas in 2012 as an Ashbel Smith Professor. She previously was a professor of supply chain management in the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University. Katok earned her bachelor’s degree in business administration with an emphasis in finance and economics from the University of California, Berkeley. She earned her MBA from Pennsylvania State University, where she also earned her PhD in management science. Endowed Chairs and Professorships 800 W.

    "text": "The University of Texas at Dallas supports the Ashbel Smith Professorship. Dr. Ashbel Smith was the first president of the UT System Board of Regents. He had a long and distinguished career in medicine, education and public service. During his term on the Board of Regents, Smith was dedicated to recruiting the best faculty members available and to developing a curriculum befitting a “university of the first class.” Smith became known as both the “father of Texas medicine” and the “father of The University of Texas.” “The Naveen Jindal School of Management and UT Dallas provide an amazing research environment through encouraging creativity and recognizing valuable research, service and teaching contributions of the faculty and students. The growth of JSOM and UT Dallas and the improvement in their worldwide recognitions have been phenomenal. I am also sure the upward trajectory will continue for years to come.” Dr. Dmitri Kuksov’s research often challenges conventional thinking about marketing strategies. One of his studies in the journal Marketing Science found that when a retailer hosts a competitor’s ad on its website, profits can increase for both companies under certain circumstances. Another study in the journal discovered that although it may be impossible to predict which fashion items will become a season’s “it” product, the process follows a set of probability rules. A central theme of most of Kuksov’s research is how uncertainty affects markets, especially when consumers can decide how much to invest in gathering information. “When you realize you don’t have all the information you need to decide if you want to buy something, do you want to spend extra time to go to more stores?” Kuksov said. “My research asks, what is the effect of those search costs under different scenarios?” In his dissertation study, Kuksov found that lower search costs — meaning the time and energy required to compare prices — can lead to higher prices. The study won the 2005 Frank M. Bass Outstanding Dissertation Paper Award, and part of the research was published in Marketing Science. Kuksov’s research has also been published in the Journal of Marketing Research and Quantitative Marketing and Economics. Kuksov is a department editor of Management Science, a senior editor of Production and Operations Management and an associate editor of Marketing Science. He has also served as a co-editor of Quantitative Marketing and Economics. With PhDs in both marketing and math, Kuksov conducts theoretical research using quantitative techniques. Kuksov said his research interests stem from his own experiences and his observations. He said he was drawn to the Naveen Jindal School of Management because of its focus on theoretical and quantitative marketing research. Kuksov joined UT Dallas in 2012 after teaching at Washington University in St. Louis. He earned a PhD in marketing from the University of California, Berkeley and a PhD in mathematics from Brigham Young University. Kuksov grew up in Belarus and earned his bachelor’s degree in math from Moscow State University. Endowed Chairs and Professorships 800 W.

The Evidence So Far,” as part of a concurring opinion. “When you’re writing about a subject that has a policy implication, you want to see policy actually being affected by what you’re writing,” Liebowitz said. “It certainly makes you feel good to see that your work is having an impact.” Liebowitz, who has been at UT Dallas since 1991, serves as the head of the UT Dallas Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation. Established in 2004, the center was one of the first think tanks in the United States to study intellectual property rights and related issues in the digital arena. He has studied and testified about the federal monopoly case against Microsoft, including a co-authored and widely-acclaimed book entitled, Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology.

The chair supports the research and scholarly activities of the holder in the Naveen Jindal School of Management. “Investiture is a tremendous demonstration of our University’s commitment to excellence in scholarship. My field is global competition. So how do universities compete? It’s really top faculty competing with other top faculty at other universities. In that regard, we are initiating at UT Dallas a fine tradition to honor top faculty.” Dr. Mike Peng is one of the most prolific and most influential scholars in global business strategy. With more than 120 articles, Peng is best known for his development of the institution-based view of strategy and his insights about the rise of emerging economies such as China in global business. Both the United Nations and the World Bank have cited his work. At UT Dallas, he has been the No. 1 contributor to the list of 45 top journals tracked by Financial Times. More than 40 of his articles appear on the Financial Times list. His best-selling textbooks, Global Strategy, Global Business and GLOBAL, have been translated into Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish, and are used in more than 30 countries. Peng was named to the Thomson Reuters World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds 2014 list, which was compiled based on papers indexed between 2002 and 2012 in 21 disciplines. Thomson Reuters’ comprehensive online research platform, Web of Science, named Peng one of the 95 most-cited researchers in the field of economics and business.

Rao was among the first scholars to examine pricing issues with respect to retailing and advertising using game theory, which provides a framework to consider the interactions of multiple decision makers. He said the research he and his colleagues performed spurred new ways of thinking about problems. “The body of research of mine in the last 15 years or so, which has been in the area of retailing, I think that’s been significant,” he said. “I’m very satisfied because it has contributed in a more comprehensive way to how we think about retailing, especially competitive retailing.” Rao has published numerous papers in marketing journals. He is the editor of the web-based marketing journal Review of Marketing Science. He serves on the advisory boards of Quantitative Marketing and Economics, and Marketing Research Network. His research has received support from corporations and national funding agencies. Rao said the most enjoyable aspect of research is working with his students and UT Dallas colleagues. “The joy of working with other people and having those very sorts of accomplishments that you feel when you’re working with other people — it’s a joint accomplishment,” he said. Rao joined the faculty in the Naveen Jindal School of Management in 1983. He has been Founders Professor since 1988. He was named Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2006.

And I think what it does is help people to recognize the forces at work that drive corporate decisions on things like compensation, the composition of boards of directors and corporate restructuring.” Among Dr. Michael Rebello’s research interests are corporate governance, corporate capital structure, corporate restructuring, security analysts and venture capital financing. “Recently, in the past five to seven years, there has been a big push to reform corporate governance,” he said. “People have been trying to come up with policies, and it wasn’t clear that the issues were fully understood. So the idea is to inform people about some of the issues that really matter and should be considered when making policy.

    "text": "Charles and Nancy Davidson created the position in August 2006 to support the research and scholarly activities of the holder in the Naveen Jindal School of Management. Sarkar filled the position in September 2011. “Anytime there is recognition of this nature from the University, that means a lot to me as an academic. On the one hand, of course, we are rewarded in other ways, too. But I think given our profession, at the end of the day, recognition like this is probably the highest form of reward that goes over and above the other more traditional reward mechanisms.” Dr. Sumit Sarkar’s research encompasses topics in knowledge management, personalization and recommendation systems, data privacy, software release, and information and knowledge quality. His early research examined uncertainty as it relates to data and knowledge in the contexts of databases and expert systems, respectively. More recently, this interest has led to examining the role of uncertainty in several diverse areas that include personalization and recommendation systems, reconciliation of data from diverse sources, data quality, and data privacy, among others. Sarkar is proud of his doctoral students, several of whom continue to conduct high-quality research. “Working with PhD students has been not only tremendously gratifying for me, but also I think quite instrumental in my being able to do the research that has earned the recognition in the first place,” he said. “They have inspired me as much as I hope I have been able to inspire them.” His research has been published in such premier business and technology journals as Management Science, Information Systems Research and Operations Research. He currently serves as an associate editor for Management Science, IEEE Transactions on Management Information Systems, Information Technology and Management, and Risk and Decision Analysis, among other publications. He served as the program co-chair for the International Conference on Information Systems, and the Conference Chair for the Workshop on Information Technology and Systems. He joined UT Dallas in 1997 and received the Outstanding Graduate Teacher award in 2000. He is the PhD program director in the Jindal School of Management and is also the academic director of the UT Dallas International Center for Decision and Risk Analysis. He received his Bachelor of Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and his MBA from the India Institute of Management, Calcutta. Sarkar earned his PhD in computers and information systems from the University of Rochester. Endowed Chairs and Professorships 800 W.

    "text": "The estate of Eugene McDermott created the chair in September 1973. Sethi filled the position in September 2011. The chair was created as enduring support to The University of Texas at Dallas. “I am honored and deeply humbled to be the holder of this chair. The Naveen Jindal School of Management has provided an environment in which to build one of the world’s best programs in operations management. The growth and intellectual development of UT Dallas during my time here has been without parallel, and I am looking forward to an even brighter future.” Dr. Suresh Sethi’s research areas are supply chain management, stochastic inventory models, dynamic advertising problems and mathematical finance. He developed the first stochastic advertising model, known as the Sethi model, which is used to analyze the dynamic relationship between advertising and sales. Sethi employed optimal control theory, an area of mathematics developed to find optimal ways to control dynamic systems and treat dynamic and stochastic problems in business. A textbook he co-authored introduced optimal control theory to business schools and spurred much research. When he arrived at UT Dallas in 1997, he embarked on building a first-class group in operations management and established the Operations Management doctoral program, which is now recognized worldwide. He is the founder and director of the UT Dallas Center for Intelligent Supply Networks, which offers solutions to supply chain challenges at regional companies using faculty research and the work of students. He has written eight books and published nearly 400 papers. He is a departmental editor for Production and Operations Management and a corresponding editor for the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization. He has served on the editorial boards of Operations Research, M&SOM (Manufacturing & Service Operations Management) and Automatica.

    "text": "Dr. Joseph C. Picken founded and played a major role in developing the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s academic program in innovation and entrepreneurship and the University’s award-winning Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. As a parting gift to the school upon his retirement in December 2018, Picken contributed funds to endow this position named in his honor. “I am honored to receive this chair at the Jindal School of Management. With the support from the dean’s office and the faculty members in my area, I hope to contribute to improving the overall reputation and visibility of our school in the future.” Dr. Riki Takeuchi teaches international human resource management and a doctoral seminar on management. His research revolves around understanding social exchange relationships among various organizational constituents. He is interested in understanding international assignment experiences for expatriates and spouses through multiple theoretical lenses and explaining the complexity associated with the adjustment process. Takeuchi also studies strategic human resource management with a particular focus on the employer-employee relationship. A third area of research is organizational behavior, broadly focusing on social exchange relationships with an emphasis on organizational justice and organizational citizenship behaviors. “My research may be considered an eclectic set of topics, but by being interested in strategic/international human resource management, I made a strategic decision early on in my career to diversify so that I can primarily focus on high-quality research ideas and outlets,” Takeuchi said. “This was due to my experience in collecting data on international/strategic human resource management studies, which is very different from typical studies in organizational behavior. But my papers were still subjected to the same standard. Nonetheless, because of these hardships, I learned different ways of conducting research that helped me to be productive.” He joined the Naveen Jindal School of Management in 2017 and previously held academic positions at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Finding new ways to inspire employees and organizations to perform at the highest level is a major theme in Takeuchi’s research. He has delved deeply into topics such as employee creativity, aspiration performance, performance change patterns and strategic human resource management. A third-degree black belt, Takeuchi is a strong proponent of physical fitness as a conduit to professional success. His research has appeared in journals such as the Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organization Science, Personnel Psychology and Strategic Management Journal, among others. “I’m a firm believer that in order to be creative and productive, you have to have a healthy mind and body,” he said. He is the consulting editor of the Journal of International Business Studies and served as the associate editor of the Academy of Management Journal from 2013-2016. He is a member of the Academy of International Business and the Academy of Management. He is also an elected fellow of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Takeuchi earned a bachelor’s degree in business management from North Carolina State University, a master’s degree in human resource management from Purdue University and a PhD in human resource management from the University of Maryland, College Park.

    "text": "The Dallas World Salute Fund of Communities Foundation of Texas created the professorship in May 2006. Tsang filled the position in September 2011. The position supports the research and scholarly activities of a distinguished professor in global strategy in the Naveen Jindal School of Management. “I think investiture helps to build the reputation of the school and UT Dallas as a university. Then, people gradually get to know more about UT Dallas in that not only do we have good teachers, but also good researchers. The top universities in the world are famous not only for teaching but also for their research.” Dr. Eric Tsang was a corporate banker at HSBC in Hong Kong when he decided to pursue a different career path. He left HSBC to work at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where he was an associate professor. “I realized that was the career I would like to have for the rest of my life because I wanted to pass my knowledge to my students and, at the same time, I wanted to do research,” he said of his teaching experience. After making his decision to join academia, he attended the University of Cambridge, where he earned his PhD in management in 1997. He taught at Wayne State University before arriving at UT Dallas in 2007. He was an honorary professor at Sun Yat-sen University in China and is a fellow of the Academy of International Business. Tsang’s main research areas in management include organizational learning, strategic alliances and entrepreneurship. He is also a leading scholar in applying philosophy to solve methodological problems related to assumption, explanation, generalization, ontology, replication, and theory testing. Some of these research results were included in his book The Philosophy of Management Research. His sole-authored article “Case Studies and Generalization in Information Systems Research: A Critical Realist Perspective” won the 2014 best paper award conferred by the Journal of Strategic Information Systems. His 2016 Academy of Management Review article “A Realist Perspective of Entrepreneurship: Opportunities as Propensities” (with Stratos Ramoglou) has contributed to the heated debate about the ontological nature of entrepreneurial opportunities. A prolific scholar, Tsang has published extensively in leading business journals, including the Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Journal of International Business Studies, Marketing Science, MIS Quarterly and Strategic Management Journal. His article “Social Capital, Networks, and Knowledge Transfer” (with Andrew Inkpen) won the 2015 Academy of Management Review Decade Award. Tsang said he enjoys grooming future researchers. “Because they are doctoral students, they are the future of our field, and they find my papers useful,” he said. “That gives me a sense of satisfaction to train the future generation of management researchers.” Tsang earned his bachelor of social sciences degree in economics from the University of Hong Kong, his MBA from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a law degree from Peking University.

    "text": "The University of Texas at Dallas supports the Ashbel Smith Professorship. Dr. Ashbel Smith was the first president of the UT System Board of Regents. He had a long and distinguished career in medicine, education and public service. During his term on the Board of Regents, Smith was dedicated to recruiting the best faculty members available and to developing a curriculum befitting a “university of the first class.” Smith became known as both the “father of Texas medicine” and the “father of The University of Texas.” “Research challenges assumptions and deepens our understanding of the world — something I’m proud to pursue in an environment that values rigor, curiosity and impact.” Dr. Harold Huibing Zhang entered academia driven by a passion for deep, analytical thinking and a desire to contribute to the understanding of financial markets through rigorous research. He chose the field of finance because of its dynamic nature and its critical role in shaping economic outcomes, both at the firm level and across global economies. Inspired by his fascination with how risks are processed in financial systems and reflected in investor and firm decisions, Zhang’s research interests are rooted in the interplay among economic forces, market participants and asset pricing. Zhang joined The University of Texas at Dallas in 2005 after holding academic positions at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Carnegie Mellon University. He teaches courses in investment theory and practice, portfolio analysis and management, and financial modeling for investment analysis, as well as a doctoral seminar on theoretical asset pricing. His work has been published in some of the leading academic journals in his discipline, including The Journal of Finance, The Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis and The Accounting Review. He received the Outstanding Graduate Teaching Award from the Naveen Jindal School of Management for 2010-2011. Zhang is an associate editor of the Journal of Financial Econometrics and the Quarterly Journal of Finance, and previously served as an associate editor of Financial Management and the Journal of Business & Economic Statistics. He is a TIAA Institute fellow emeritus and received the institute’s 2004 Paul A. Samuelson Award for outstanding scholarly writing on lifelong financial security for the paper “Optimal Asset Location and Allocation with Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing,” published in The Journal of Finance. Zhang is a member of The American Finance Association and the Society for Financial Studies. He earned his bachelor’s degree in ocean engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a PhD in economics from Duke University. Endowed Chairs and Professorships 800 W.

The professorship supports the research and scholarly activities of the holder in the Naveen Jindal School of Management. “The professors at the Naveen Jindal School of Management are among the most productive in the country. I am proud to be among this group and look forward to working with them to grow the school and provide insights to our bright students.” Dr. Zhiqiang (Eric) Zheng is, in essence, a consumer advocate. His data analysis research focuses on how organizations can improve their customer service and how consumers can make better buying decisions. One area of study for Zheng is how new technology can be used to innovate financial processes and services. He has been researching social trading, a new phenomenon where a person uses social media to follow groups of investors. Then, if consumers like what they see, they can make stock purchases that mirror a particular investor from the group. Another research focus is health care analytics, specifically electronic medical records and how they are managed and shared by hospitals. The goal of such work would be to help hospitals, for example, reduce readmission rate or duplicated tests. “If a chronic patient is treated by one hospital and then, a few days later, is treated at another hospital, the second hospital typically would redo a number of the tests, even though the same tests at the first hospital would still be valid,” Zheng said. “We are looking at a health information exchange system (HIE) to see if it would reduce such unnecessary, duplicated tests.” Zheng is a senior editor at Information Systems Research and has served roles for INFORMS Journal on Computing, Information Technology Management, Journal of E-commerce Research and Journal of Management Analytics. He recently secured three grants worth more than $1.3 million supporting his research on big data analytics, health care analytics and financial technology. In addition, several of Zheng’s research articles have earned best paper awards by journals and various conferences. Zheng earned his PhD in information systems in 2003 from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he also earned his master’s degree. He began teaching at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2006 as an assistant professor in information systems and operations management at the Jindal School. He was promoted to professor in 2015. Zheng also teaches a class on financial technology. Prior to joining UT Dallas, he was an assistant professor in the business school at the University of California, Riverside.

The book also provides a high-level overview of the underlying technologies driving the IoT and Biometrics. However, the emphasis of the book is on the business side. Some of the main topics covered are: Breaking Failure©: (Financial Times Press-Pearson). Breaking Failure proposes adapting and applying three scientific techniques from other disciplines to business areas such as marketing, product management, sales and strategic planning. This concept is called a knowledge domain transfer. Other sections of Breaking Failure, explore the 80/20 of business mistakes and ways to prevent or mitigate them through additional approaches using case studies from Motorola, New Coke and Microsoft. The last section of the book addresses those instances when failure prevention or turnarounds are not possible or desirable—and offers a pre-planned exit strategy roadmap with checklists and key considerations. The epilogue discusses other challenges and opportunities in the field of failure prevention with the emergence of machine learning. 800 W Campbell Road, Richardson, TX 75080, USA · (972) 883-2705"

Frist, he investigates the mechanisms through which teams and organizations exhibit resilience and adapt in the wake of disruptive changes, focusing on the processes that facilitate their recovery and growth. Second, he examines the complex interplay of social factors that coalesce to influence group functionality, aiming to decipher how these dynamics impact collective performance and outcomes. Third, he analyzes the ways in which leader attributes and behaviors manifest and evolve, and how they affect the performance and dynamics of individuals and teams, with a particular interest in how leadership qualities translate into concrete results. In recent years, Alex has published in top-tier management journals such as the Academy of Management Journal, Organization Science, the Journal of Applied Psychology, Personnel Psychology, and the Journal of Organizational Behavior. His expertise also extends to the practical business domain, with publications in the MIT Sloan Management Review.

    "text": "Since Naveen Jindal earned his MBA from UT Dallas in 1992, he has thrived beyond college successes to become a leading industrialist, practiced statesman and driving force for higher education in his home country, India. Named a 2010 UT Dallas Distinguished Alumnus, he targeted support to the School of Management in the largest alumni gift ever given to the University at that time. His gift, together with that of fellow alumni Charles and Nancy Davidson, created a philanthropic package valued, with matching funds, at $45 million. The University of Texas Board of Regents recognized his philanthropy by naming the school the Naveen Jindal School of Management. “My vision and desire,” Jindal said, “is that the [Jindal] School of Management becomes the school of choice for some of the brightest and best individuals who will truly lead us into the next generation, leaders who will truly embrace the global vision and balance the needs of the people with the environment in an ethical and sustainable manner.” In memory of his late father, Naveen Jindal founded and is chancellor of the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in Haryana, India. JGU has eight schools: art and architecture, banking and finance, business, government and public policy, international affairs, journalism and communication, law and liberal arts and humanities. Jindal’s business career has roots in the O.P. Jindal Group, a multibillion-dollar family conglomerate. He serves as chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, a steel manufacturer that has diversified into cement production, mining, oil and gas and power generation. A national record holder in India for skeet shooting and an adept polo player, Jindal found another passion while at UT Dallas — politics. He served first as Student Government vice president and then president, at the same time earning the Student Leader of the Year Award. Inspired by displays of the U.S. flag on campus, he later successfully challenged India’s Flag Code, which allowed the banner to be put on view only on special occasions. The effort led him to found the Flag Foundation of India and birthed his parliamentary career. He served two five-year terms in the Lok Sabha, Parliament’s lower house. Besides education, his public and private development initiatives have focused on healthcare, infrastructure, women’s empowerment and youth. In 2023, Jindal returned to UT Dallas as one of the university’s most accomplished alumni, noted as a global leader in industry, a statesman in his home country of India, an advocate for human rights and a record-holding sportsman. He was presented with the University’s Lifetime Achievement Award. At the Awards Gala, Jindal said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award renewed his commitment to making a difference in the world. “For me, this award is not just a recognition of my past accomplishments, but a call to action for the future,” Jindal said. “There is still so much work to be done, but I believe we all have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to make the world a better place.”"

    "text": "The Jindal School offers honors programs that provide high-performing and exceptionally motivated students with a range of learning experiences designed to help them reach their potential as scholars and leaders. DMHP provides many development opportunities. Challenging academics will ensure that you have the technical skills you need to thrive in your career. We create unique cohorts of students with different majors and experiences. The cohorts are generally small — ranging from 60 to 70 students, allowing for discussion-based classes, more personal interaction and the formation of lasting relationships. The Nash Leader’s Program is designed to help elevate the leadership potential of high-performing students by providing access to a robust set of leadership opportunities while enrolled in their degree program. This program offers a roadmap for students to receive the Nash Leader Award upon graduation."

The best time for students to attend exchange programs is during the spring semester of their sophomore year. The selection process for an exchange program is competitive and can be found below: There are many ways to find an international internship. Some students use their personal connections, while others find positions listed on Handshake or through an internship placement company. Many of our students have used companies like The Intern Group in the past. When students use an internship placement company, they pay a fee directly to the placement company that finds internships in their field of study. These companies often help students obtain their visas, find a place to live, find transportation to/from the airport and more. It is important to remember that because of visa requirements, international internships are unpaid positions. Be Advised: Once hired for an international internship, you MUST report it to UT Dallas in Orion and in the Comets Abroad Portal. On a faculty-led trip, the instructor and enrolled students travel to a country to visit various companies and learn about their operations compared to similar companies in the United States. Students may also venture for sightseeing and learn about the country’s culture and history. These international study trips usually last approximately 7- 10 days and often take place over Spring Break or Fall Break. Students pay tuition for the course and a program fee that covers their participation in the program. Students are responsible for their own additional fees and expenses. One of the most important questions students have about studying abroad is how to fund their experience. There are many ways to create an affordable opportunity, and students can start by checking the study abroad scholarship programs.Students can apply for two available scholarships by the published deadline: The International Education Fund Scholarship is for UT Dallas students who are participating in an International Education program. If awarded an IEF scholarship, all requirements in your program application will need to be completed before funds can be disbursed."

Expand your network and advance your future career with JindalConnect. Connecting with Jindal School Comets One of the most meaningful ways UT Dallas Jindal School alumni can give back is by serving as a mentor to students. The JindalConnect Alumni Interview Program fosters meaningful relationships between the school’s alumni and its students. Students repeatedly say having a mentor is one of the most impactful experiences of their education. This program starts with a formal interview process that Jindal School undergraduate students are required to do as one of their academic assignments. Mentors answer a series of job-related questions students must ask to complete the career exploration component of their class. From there, the traditional mentoring role may take place. The alumni mentoring role is a way that only you, as an alumnus or alumna, can give back to your alma mater. You can do as much as your schedule allows after the initial Alumni Interview Program component is complete. You can do anything from sending an encouraging text message once a week to exchanging emails or phone calls or even face-to-face time over coffee. The pace and amount of interaction is up to you. You have exclusive access to JSOM’s robust global network of alumni who are eager and willing to share their wisdom and advice about life beyond UT Dallas. Alumni indicate on their JindalConnect profile if they are willing to serve as a mentor. The JindalConnect mentoring program is a special opportunity for you to get to know and learn from an alumnus/alumna. As a participant, you will have a chance to request a mentor to assist you with academic guidance, career advice and personal development."

The center will conduct business research, host executive training on Fintech and Digital Asset Management and investigate phenomena of interest across all members of the financial technologies ecosystem. The center works in collaboration with industry, policymakers and academia and has close ties with the local business community. In the year 2030, the Jindal School is a global research leader in the management of Financial and Digital Asset Technologies. Financial and Digital Asset Technologies will reshape financial services and digital asset management over the next two decades. The emergence of new financial services, digital asset management and the corresponding digital economy will be the most significant and disruptive trends. Our vision for the center is the creation of applied knowledge to manage financial and digital asset technologies. Besides creating significant value for end-consumers, financial and digital asset technologies will impact financial institutions (e.g., banks), capital markets and regulatory bodies. Data will become a key asset for individuals and institutions. We will see the disintermediation of traditional intermediaries (such as banks and stock exchanges) by nimble Fintechs that will be service-oriented rather than the supply-driven model of traditional financial companies. This reintermediation will deliver more value at higher efficiency by exploiting new information technologies (such as blockchain, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning and others). A key competitive advantage of future financial services firms will be their ability to manage and monetize data as assets. There will be a shift in the core business models of firms in this sector from financial arbitrage to information arbitrage.

The center supports research and educational programs related to new products and the management of established products. Marketing is the key to new product success. Whether a company is in a dynamic, high-technology industry, an industry reshaped by deregulation or an industry faced with increased competition, it must first understand customer needs. Yet a gap often exists between a company’s engineering and R&D skills and its marketing capability. To help close this gap, the center carries out activities aimed at coordinating the functions of technology and marketing. The Morris Hite Center was established to encourage research in marketing science and product development. Areas of research include topics in internet marketing, customer relationship management, product creation and sales forecasting. Morris Hite Center is proud to sponsor the annual Frank M. Bass Frontiers of Research in Marketing Science (Bass FORMS) conference every year in February-March.

    "title": "The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™",
    "text": "The UT Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management has created a database to track publications in 24 leading business journals. The database contains titles and author affiliations of papers published in these journals since 1990. The information in the database is used to provide the top 100 business school rankings since 1990 based on the total contributions of faculty. The Jindal School of Management maintains and keeps this website current to provide timely data on research productivity in leading research journals across major disciplines in business schools. The school has worked hard to ensure data integrity, but as with any project of this type where the affiliation data is not always clear, some errors may exist. If you spot an error, please send us the corrections at Top 100 Admin. UT Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management provides a tool to study research articles/notes published in 24 leading journals in major business disciplines. The database contains author and their affiliation information on all research articles/notes published in these journals since 1990. Authors’ affiliations are recorded at the time of the publication. A single-authored research article/note results in the school of affiliation being credited with a score of 1. If there are multiple authors from different schools, each school gets a score of p/n, where p is the number of authors from the same school and there are a total of n authors on the article. If an author lists multiple affiliations, each of the school that author is affiliated with gets a corresponding scaled score. For example, if one of the n authors lists m affiliations, each school that author is affiliated with gets a score of 1/nm. The database can be searched by any period between 1990 to the current year for any combination of journals, resulting in aggregated scores for schools. This provides a clear picture of contributions from each school for the selected journals and the time period. The database can also be searched by school names, author names and key phrases in the article’s title. The Jindal School of Management also provides a ranking of the top 100 schools in North America and Worldwide based on published research articles/notes in all 24 journals for the last five-year time period. The school also provides links to prior rankings starting with the period 2000-2004. The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings methodology has been amended effective 15th June 2017. The modification affects business schools whose authors have listed affiliations with either the National Bureau of Economic Research and/or the Centre for Economic Policy Research along with their university affiliations. The new methodology assigns full credit to the author’s university affiliation when computing the rankings (in the prior rankings each affiliation received 1/n where n was the number of affiliations the author listed). This change will be reflected only in the rankings going forward and the prior published rankings have not been amended. The UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings methodology has been amended effective 18th March 2020. The modification affects refereed articles in the Journal of International Business Studies. Prior to March 18, 2020, only articles published in the Original Paper category were included in the rankings. Now refereed articles from the other categories are also included in the rankings. This change is reflected in the current rankings and in rankings generated as a result of queries posed within Rankings by Journal. Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information, the nature and diversity in which author affiliation information is provided in the journals sometimes make it hard to categorize and report the information accurately. UT Dallas’ Jindal School of Management has attempted to verify information using the web when possible. While searching for articles, author names are provided in the search results. They are not listed in the sequence specified in the published paper. Also note that when information on authors is provided, if the same author is listed twice, it indicates that the author has listed multiple affiliations. If you believe there is an error in the information provided, please send specific information to the administrator. The Naveen Jindal School of Management appreciates your input to this ongoing research effort. Sincerely, Naveen Jindal School of Management"

With around 6 years of experience in oil field service and equipment industry, I came to UT Dallas to study Energy Management as it offers me courses in general management and energy business. Professors at UTD are industry experts and impart the understanding in the three sectors of energy business with real world example.

    "text": "On September 7, 2018, MS in Energy Management students visited a Total urban gas drilling operation in Arlington, Texas. Total contracted with Trinidad Drilling’s rig 129, to drill the Cornerstone North 4H well. UT Dallas sent 40 students from four classes – ENGY 6v99, BA 4V00-001, BA 4V00-003 and ENGY 6330 – on morning and afternoon visits. Broken up into small teams for safety reasons, they were given rig tours by Total’s Senior Production Operations Engineer, Drilling Consultant, Resident Safety Specialists and others. I am an electrical engineer and have worked as an assistant professor for six-plus years. While working as a professor, I felt that it is equally important to learn the business side of the industry. And that thought inspired me to pursue my second master’s in energy management. The Energy Association – UT Dallas is a professional student organization that serves as a bridge between academics and industry. The organization’s mission is to provide networking and professional development opportunities for UT Dallas students interested in pursuing careers in the energy industry.

Read their stories and discover how the finance program has made an impact on their professional and personal lives. Noah Harness, Class of 2020 My biggest takeaway from the MSF program is my improved knowledge of statistical and quantitative methods and their applications to solving business and financial problems. Hui (Vivienne) Zhi, Class of 2020 The job market in the DFW area is growing rapidly, and the area was ranked No. 1 Best City for Jobs by Forbes in 2020. The job opportunities are always out there if you are ready with the necessary skill set. Jiaojiao Li, Class of 2020 Looking back, the most important thing I want to share with you is: Be open-minded, reach out to veteran students, your professors, your program advisors and the Career Management Center. Be proactive. Nidhi Khetan, Class of 2020 As a child, I grew up listening to dinner-table conversations between my father, uncle and grandfather, discussing strategies to expand our business and overcome financial hurdles along the way. This struck a spark in me to understand how business and finance work. Kamiar Kordi hopes to revolutionize politics by increasing awareness and connection between constituents and their representatives. In his interview, Kamiar shares how UT Dallas helped him reach for success and make a change. Ankita Kapoor, a junior accounting and finance major at the Jindal School, recently interned with the tax department at KPMG, an international audit, tax and advisory company, to learn more about the work and see if it was right for her. In her interview, Ankita discusses the importance of an internship in ensuring your field is right for you before you graduate Fernanda Muñoz, a global business and finance student at the Jindal School of Management, accepted an internship at Top Golf International to dive into the field of finance. In this interview, Fernanda shares details of her experience, including how essential it is to network. As an accounting and finance major at the Naveen Jindal School of Management, Dapo Ogunfeitimi landed a summer internship to gain experience in the field. In this interview, Dapo doesn’t leave out any details of his summer-long experience — even if it means revealing some embarrassing information. We saw solar plants, coal plants, and we actually got lectures from people who are there inside. And you got a very good idea about how they run and a very practical approach, which was very important. As part of my degree, one of the electives that I took was energy economics. We got to see different CEOs and CFOs Wall Street pitch. We got to see their whole process. We learned from the energy management course that a lot of economic things in finance about contracts and some technologies are related to the energy industry, including the solar, wind, oil and gas — even the nuclear energy. I am an electrical engineer and have worked as an assistant professor for six-plus years. While working as a professor, I felt that it is equally important to learn the business side of the industry. And that thought inspired me to pursue my second master’s in energy management.

And you got a very good idea about how they run and a very practical approach, which was very important. As part of my degree, one of the electives that I took was energy economics.

And that thought inspired me to pursue my second master’s in energy management.

From an educational standpoint, it not only solidified my passion for supply chain but also enabled me to enhance my skills and knowledge while graduating early, propelling me forward in my graduate studies. I discovered that the graduate-level courses challenged me in a different way from my undergraduate ones, and my professors were deeply invested in teaching their expertise with genuine enthusiasm. Many of my fellow students who pushed off their graduate studies found juggling work and school to be draining, resulting in a prolonged timeline spanning several years to earn their master’s degree rather than the accelerated 2-3 semesters that I was able to do. I wholeheartedly recommend Fast Track to any student considering it.” Before you apply, get familiar with the application process for Jindal School graduate programs at UT Dallas."

    "title": "Advertising & Branding Track",
    "text": "In the Master of Science in Marketing Advertising and Branding Track, students must complete 15 credit hours of program core classes then 21 credit hours within this track in courses in advertising and promotional strategy, branding, consumer behavior and social media. There is a wide range of electives, including digital advertising courses. Details of the courses in the degree and this track are available on the Master’s in Marketing page in the UT Dallas Graduate Catalog. Our program is designed to prepare students for careers in advertising and marketing agencies as well as advertising and branding jobs within companies. An advertising manager or account executive has been described as the bridge between client companies and the advertising or marketing agency. These professionals connect with agency teams serving many functions, such as the creative, media and print and/or broadcast production teams. They have regular meetings with their clients and are responsible for seeing that work is billed and paid for. Ad executives usually lead presentations to clients. While advertising and branding careers are different, in this track we combined both into one track because they do share some core skills and knowledge, such as consumer behavior or advertising (key for branding). Specialization occurs more in the elective part of this track, where students focused more on the advertising side can concentrate more on digital courses while those interested more in the branding side can take the customer insights and research side of the track electives. For additional details on how our courses map to the skills required by this profession, please read this blog post on advertising management. A brand manager is responsible for developing, nurturing, managing and protecting the identity of a brand. In consumer-packaged goods (CPG) companies, a brand manager may have even more responsibilities, including profit and loss. In other companies and industries, brand managers have a narrower role. Profit-and-loss responsibilities usually fall to product managers in manufacturing, equipment, technology and healthcare companies. A brand manager in the narrower role audits and establishes how a brand is perceived by the market. Brand managers make sure that all the components of the brand, such as its name, logo, colors, packaging, price points and distribution, complement the desired perception. For additional details on how our courses map to the skills required by this profession, please read this blog post on brand management. Advertising manager Account executive Account planner Account supervisor or manager Brand manager, director or vice president Media planner/buyer There will always be advertising jobs, but the traditional job market is relatively flat. Minimal growth is expected in the future as most budgets move to digital advertising. A recent survey of 400 advertising and marketing agencies reported that 78% of the firms would maintain their current headcount, with no new hiring except to fill vacancies. With the cutbacks in traditional advertising spending and retrenchment by clients, hiring is expected to be flat. This track specialty is best for those already in advertising who wish to obtain higher-level managerial knowledge, especially on the data analysis and digital side. Because brand managers play a key role in increasing market share, the employment outlook is good for this field. According to CNN Money: Students searching this job market will have to read the job descriptions carefully. While all the job titles shown above are commonly used in the marketing and advertising industry, such titles are used in other areas as well. “Account executive” is commonly used for sales positions in newspapers and media companies looking for people willing to work only on commission. On Indeed.com, “account supervisor,” which is usually found only in advertising and marketing firms, yields more than 5,000 jobs across the U.S. If “brand manager” is used in a search on Indeed.com or Glassdoor.com, then some 1,150 jobs in the U.S. are returned. “Brand management” yields far fewer: only 67 open positions. Traditionally, beginners in marketing and advertising are not paid well. This has not changed. A young marketing manager with less than three years of experience can expect a salary in the $40,000 to $50,000 range. However, with experience and such strategic career moves as earning a master’s degree, salary can increase. An advertising account supervisor (more than three years’ experience) in Dallas is projected to earn a median annual salary of more than $70,000, according to PayScale.com. A decade of experience and a VP title can mean a salary of $145,000 and up, including bonuses. Brand managers can work on the advertising/marketing agency side or for a corporation, managing one of the portfolio brands. Agency brand managers with three years of experience tend to have salaries on the lower side: $40,000 to $55,000. For a corporate brand manager with three years of experience, salaries range from $55,000 to $128,000. Find advice and resources you need as a current or prospective graduate student in marketing.

    "text": "The MS SEM program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to learn in areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time MS SEM students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. The MS SEM degree requires a total of 36 credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the non-thesis option or 10 courses plus six hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic adviser and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without adviser approval will not count toward the 36 semester-hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the MS SEM degree. Please also note that the University’s general degree requirements are discussed in the graduate catalog. Completion of a minimum of 36 semester hours of graduate-level lecture courses including the required core courses. With adviser approval, these may include some 5000 level courses. Students must earn a grade of B- or better in each of four core courses (see below). An alternative to the 36 credit-hour requirement for the MS SEM degree is the completion of a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate-level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see below), six semester hours of a combination of master’s research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis. Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research adviser during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research adviser. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester they are also working full-time. Research and thesis hours cannot be counted in an MS SEM degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student’s thesis adviser prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With adviser approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time UT Dallas students who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester. Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from a set of eight courses from the lists below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree. Students are required to take an additional four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the set of eight core courses listed above and/or the set of courses listed below. Two of these courses must be chosen from the two Engineering sections (core and elective), and two from the two Management sections (core and elective). Because a program objective is to maintain a high degree of flexibility, students are encouraged to work with an MS-SEM program advisor to discuss possible (limited) exceptions and substitutions for the prescribed elective courses. Working with a SEM program advisor, students take four additional and distinct courses from either the remaining 12 courses from the lists above that have not already been taken as required courses or prescribed elective courses, or from other courses offered in management or engineering that form a “concentration” or “specialization” in specific industry sectors.

    "text": "High-performing undergraduates who want to get a head start on earning their MS in Systems Engineering and Management can take advantage of the Fast-Track program. This program can help position undergraduates to more quickly earn their Master’s and begin pursuing careers in a variety of industries including cybersecurity, healthcare, finance, defense, space, transportation, and other high-tech fields. The MS in SEM program offers a cross-track option similar to the Fast-Track option for other programs in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. Differences include the additional requirement of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited program in engineering and the selection of six benchmark courses from those listed for the undergraduate degree programs in the Jonsson School Fast-Track option. Upon approval by the SEM graduate admissions committee, up to two of the six benchmark courses may come from outside this list, provided: Students in the cross-track option must attain an average GPA of at least 3.33 in the six benchmark courses. It is important to note that all students interested in the Fast-Track-to-SEM program must have completed the stated prerequisites (or their equivalents) or obtained permission from their advisor and course instructor for any graduate SEM class in which they enroll. Interested students should therefore consult with the list of required and prescribed graduate-level elective SEM courses (at most five of which can be taken before graduating with a BS degree). Students satisfying these requirements and in the process of completing the BS-CS, BS-CE, BS-SE, BS-TE, BS-EE, or BS-MECH receive automatic admission to the MS SEM program with no requirement to take the GRE or GMAT. All other general Fast-Track requirements and guidelines apply, including those pertaining to conditional acceptance into the program. Systems Engineering and Management - 800 W.

    "title": "SEM: Traditional Master’s FAQ  UT Dallas",
    "text": "We put this FAQ page together to help answer the most common questions new students have about the Traditional Master’s in SEM program. Please read this page to become acquainted with the program. We also invite you to view our Traditional Master’s program overview and degree plan pages. If you have further questions, we invite you to contact us. What is systems engineering and what is the MS in Systems Engineering and Management (SEM) about? Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the design, modeling, interconnection and management of large complex systems. In addition to the methods of traditional engineering, systems engineering relies on skills and expertise in areas such as optimization, simulation, economics and finance, risk management and decision making under uncertainty. These skills come together to address the challenges of designing and managing complex interconnected systems, ranging from an automobile or an airplane to communication systems, financial markets, the power grid, and many more. The Master’s in Systems Engineering and Management (MS SEM) program is delivered through an equal partnership between the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and the Naveen Jindal School of Management. The program focuses on educating students in the broad disciplines of Systems Engineering and Systems Management. Focused concentrations appealing to various industrial applications include: aerospace, defense and space systems; transportation systems; information and communications technology systems; information assurance and cybersecurity systems; health care systems; energy, environment and infrastructure systems; complex biological systems; and macro-economic and financial systems. Faculty for the primary SEM courses are drawn from both the engineering and management schools; faculty from other UT Dallas schools, and industry leaders with expertise in specific fields teach other courses as appropriate. What are the admissions requirements, and how do I apply for the MS SEM program? Refer to admissions requirements and the application process for the MS SEM program. What undergraduate degree do I need to have to apply to the MS SEM program? If you have an undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, chemistry, math, economics or finance, you may have an adequate background in math to enter the program. If your math background does not include at least one year of calculus, a course in linear algebra, and a course in probability and statistics, you may need to strengthen your math skills with leveling courses. What quantitative skills are required? Students are expected to have taken calculus, statistics and linear algebra. Many MS SEM engineering courses are quantitatively oriented, and students with less aptitude and education in quantitative methods are at a disadvantage. Where can I find more details on the tracks and courses? Please see: How long does it usually take to complete the MS SEM program? The MS in Systems Engineering and Management is a 36-credit-hour program, excluding prerequisites. It usually takes 4 semesters to complete the program at 9 hours per semester. It is possible to complete the program in a shorter time frame, if desired courses are available in the summer, but the course load will be heavy and challenging. Some students enroll on a part-time basis and take longer to complete the program. Do I need to have work experience to apply to the MS SEM program? Work experience is not required for students in the Traditional MS SEM program. I am from a foreign country. Can I be accepted into the MS SEM program? Yes. We have many international students from many countries, and our faculty is also international. However, international students must have student visas, are required to carry a minimum course load of nine credit hours in the fall and spring semesters and must follow international student guidelines, as outlined by UT Dallas International Student Services. Is financial aid available? For students in the traditional MS SEM program, a limited number of Dean’s Scholarships are available, offering $1,000 and qualification for in-state tuition. For a list of available scholarships, see the ECS Graduate Scholarships page. The “Fast Track to SEM Scholarship” is available only to UT Dallas undergraduates, and offers $1,000 per semester in Graduate School, up to $3000. All students can find more information at Financial Aid for the SEM Program. Are there any areas of concentration in the MS SEM program? Students can concentrate in several areas indicated on the SEM Concentrations page. Concentrations are designed to provide the optimal set of courses to prepare for specific careers in SEM, in specific industries or industry sectors. Do I have to declare a concentration to receive my degree? No. You must complete a minimum of 12 courses (36 credit hours) to earn an MS SEM degree. A requirement of 4 engineering courses (2 must be core courses) and 4 management courses (2 must be core courses) must be met. The student may then choose the remaining 4 courses from the degree plan, a list of pre-approved concentrations, or create their own concentration as it relates to systems engineering. Your concentration will not appear on your diploma. What are the course requirements for each concentration? Typical courses appropriate for each concentration are listed at SEM Concentrations. You can discuss alternatives with your adviser. What kind of careers can I look forward to, and what employers hire MS SEM graduates? There are many career paths in SEM. See Career Path for examples. Are there any online classes for the MS SEM degree? Some classes are available online, and we will be looking into expanding the number of offerings in the future. I am a transfer student. Can I transfer some of my graduate courses from my previous university? Transfer credits may be granted for equivalent graduate course work completed at other accredited universities with a grade of B or better within the past six years. Up to nine credit hours of course work from other universities may be transferred to the degree program, but the courses must fit into the MS SEM degree program. Transfer credits must be approved, first by your department advisor, then by the relevant faculty member for the course for which equivalence is being sought, and then by the director of the MS SEM program. Contact us for additional information. Can I receive transfer credit for undergraduate courses that cover the same material as your graduate courses? No. Can courses be taken at other institutions after enrolling in the UT Dallas SEM graduate program? Students officially admitted to the UT Dallas MS SEM graduate program must obtain prior approval before taking any courses at another university. The resultant transfer hours may be denied if prior approval is not obtained. Contact Us for details on applying for pre-approvals. Can I get credit for an internship? Jonsson Career Services (JCS) includes graduate study participation in cooperative education, internships, and Curricular Practical Training (CPT). International Students: Must meet USCIS and UTD eligibility requirements for CPT. All international students are required to attend an JCS CPT orientation session to ensure they understand the internship procedures and complete the processes in order to be eligible to participate in the ECS internship program. International students are mandated to register for the JCS one credit hour course (this one credit hour cannot be counted toward the 36 credit hour degree plan requirement). Please see the Student Handbook on the JCS page for more details. Are joint degrees available? Yes. Students can enroll in the MS SEM and MBA programs concurrently and can complete the double MS SEM and MBA program with as few as 63 credit hours. Find more information at MS/MBA. Careful planning is required, and we recommend you speak to your MS SEM adviser prior to applying. What are the faculty’s credentials?

    "title": "Professional Master’s FAQ  UTD Systems Engineering & Management",
    "text": "As a busy professional you may have wondered how you would ever get the time to pursue a Master’s degree in Systems Engineering and Management. What sacrifices would you have to make in your work or personal life to gain this credential? Thankfully, has created a Professional Systems Engineering and Management Master’s degree that will allow you to keep your present job and personal obligations while you pursue your education. Find out more about it in the FAQs below. What is the study of Professional MS in Systems Engineering and Management (P-SEM) about? The Professional MS P-SEM program provides a broad-based, formalized education in engineering and management of increasingly complex “macro” systems with a large number of interdependent parts that have a significant organizational or societal impact. These areas are at the intersection of the traditionally separate disciplines of systems engineering and systems management. The current business environment requires that engineers in industry and government be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, managers in industry need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their companies and the society at large. The Professional MS P-SEM program provides this training. What are the admissions requirements, and how do I apply for the Professional MS P-SEM program? For admissions requirements and to apply to the Professional MS P-SEM program, please visit the Apply page. What undergraduate degree do I need to apply to the Professional MS P-SEM program? If you have an undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, chemistry, math, economics or finance, you probably have an adequate background in math for the program. If your undergraduate degree is in another field, you may need to strengthen your math skills. How long does it usually take to complete the Professional MS P-SEM program? The Professional MS P-SEM is a 36-credit-hour program consisting of 12 courses which can be completed on a part-time or full-time basis. The time to complete the program varies depending upon a number of factors including what courses you choose to take in your degree plan to customize your degree to suit your career direction, how many courses you sign up for each semester, availability of desired elective courses, schedule restrictions and mandatory enrollment requirements. While all requirements for the Master’s degree must be completed within one six-year period, and while the fastest anyone has completed this degree is in 15 months, most students take between 2 to 3 years to complete the degree. Do I need to have work experience to apply to the Professional MS P-SEM program? A minimum of three years of relevant work experience is preferred for the Professional Education-based MS SEM program (P-SEM). Candidates with less work experience, unless they are working full time and hence cannot attend classes during weekdays, may consider the Traditional Master’s Degree in SEM (TSEM) program. The Traditional MS SEM follows the same degree plan, but is taught in a full time format on regular weekdays. I am from a foreign country. Can I be accepted into the Professional MS P-SEM program? Yes, as an international student, you may be accepted into the program. Our International Student Services Office (ISSO) provides immigration information and support to our UT Dallas students. What quantitative skills are required? Students are expected to have taken advanced calculus, linear algebra, and probability & statistics. Many Professional MS P-SEM engineering courses are quantitatively oriented, and students with less aptitude and education in quantitative methods are at a disadvantage. Is financial aid available? Students can find more information at Financial Aid for the SEM Program. Please contact the designated UT Dallas financial aid counselor for Professional Education, Bill Mack or call him at 972-883-4114. Are there any areas of concentration in the Professional MS P-SEM program? Students may select one of the concentrations listed on the SEM Concentrations page. Concentrations are not required, but rather assist students in course selection if they wish to focus in a particular area. They do not appear on the diploma. Courses listed under each concentration are only suggestions of courses most relevant to that concentration. Also, in lieu of a concentration, students may either – (a) choose to take more courses from the SEM core and prescribed elective courses, or (b) choose their own free elective courses, as long as they get prior approval from PSEM Program Administration. What is the purpose of having a concentration? Concentrations are designed to provide the optimal set of courses to prepare for specific careers in SEM in specific industries or industry sectors. They do not appear on the MS SEM diploma. Do I have to declare a concentration to receive my degree? No. You must complete a minimum of 12 courses (36 credit hours) and follow the approved degree plan to earn the Professional MS P-SEM degree. Your concentration will not appear on your diploma. What kind of careers can I look forward to, and what employers hire Professional MS P-SEM graduates? There are many career paths in systems engineering and management. See Career Path in SEM for examples. Are there any online classes for the Professional MS P-SEM degree? Not at this time, but we will be looking into that in the future. I am a transfer student. Can I transfer some of my graduate courses from my previous university? A maximum of 9 credit hours of transfer credits may be granted for equivalent graduate course work completed at other accredited universities with a grade of B or better. All transfer credit requests must be made within the student’s first year of admission into the degree-seeking program. Approval to use these credits towards the PSEM degree must be granted by the director of the PSEM program. Visit the Jindal School of Management (JSOM) forms page to download the form and the complete list of transfer request rules for transfer credit through JSOM. [For non-JSOM coursework, please contact the appropriate school for transfer request policies and procedures.] NOTE: Acceptance of transfer of semester credit hours will not occur until after the student has completed 9 semester credit hours at UT Dallas with a grade point average of at least 3.0. Can I receive transfer credit for undergraduate courses that cover the same material as your graduate courses? No. The 36-hour requirement will not be reduced based on undergraduate coursework. However, you may apply for a waiver of one or more of the core courses. Please see the Waiver Request Rules and Waiver Request Submission Form on the JSOM forms page. Can courses be taken at other institutions after enrolling in the UT Dallas SEM graduate program? Students officially admitted to the UT Dallas – SEM graduate program must obtain prior approval before taking any courses at another university. The resultant transfer hours may be denied if prior approval is not obtained. See the Advising Office for details on applying for pre-approvals. Can I get credit for an internship? Yes. Students can obtain credit for an internship provided they have followed the university guidelines which includes approval by the PSEM program director. A maximum of three credit hours can be earned and is considered a free elective. Students must register for the internship course through the PSEM program. Students interested in pursuing an internship should work closely with the UTD and JSOM career centers. Please visit the following links for internship information & guidelines: Are joint degrees available? Students can obtain both the Professional MS SEM (PSEM) degree and MBA degree with a minimum of 63 total credit hours as long as: Careful planning is required to assure you are meeting the requirements of both degree plans so we recommend you consult your PSEM advisor.

Please contact the JSOM advising office for more information about the double degrees and requirements.

Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in the core courses and cumulative, for both degrees, to qualify for one or the other or both degrees. The MS/MBA students must complete both programs at the same time to be awarded both degrees. Students interested in combining the Full-Time MBA Cohort or Professional MBA Evening Cohort program with an MS Degree will not apply to the MS Program until they are already admitted to the MBA Program.

Our board of 50 phenomenal industry professionals are assigned to one-on-one relationships with our students. Our faculty and staff serve to teach our students what they need to know. It is our mentors who help guide our students through the challenges they face in making the most of that knowledge. Our one-on-one format is critical due to the diversity of our group — no two students need exactly the same guidance. We also allow students to meet and choose their mentors based on chemistry and not just company or functional role as we know, working with someone that you click with can make all the difference. Our mentors are a critical piece in the transformation of our students. It is wonderful when we have an alumnus return to serve future students. Students provide us with feedback on who they may want as a mentor. Shared background, common interest, industry alignment or the company the mentor works for are all some of the reasons why a student would desire to work with a specific mentor. Our mentors serve to assist students in developing their network within the DFW area. This assistance is of critical importance for our international and out of state students. Jump right into a full-time experience that will allow you time to research your passions and interests and engage in the world with companies, alumni and faculty.

Global Leadership in VUCA Environment: Leading Dual Transformation By: Dr. Keith Thurgood We live in a dynamic and connected world. One could argue that the global environment is more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) than ever before. The rapid digitization and virtualization of the world, coupled with the increasing requirement to respond to multiple stakeholders, not just shareholders, underscores the importance of and need for adaptable and agile enterprise leaders that deliver results in the short term and create shared value in the long term. These leaders not only leverage vertical or functional expertise to drive operational excellence but also understand that global dexterity and horizontal enterprise leadership matters from a performance and change leadership perspective. The practitioners of horizontal leadership enable radical collaboration and transformational change across the entire enterprise while simultaneously delivering results. In short, they are “market multipliers” delivering a “dual transformation.” This type of transformation balances short-term outcomes but simultaneously enables the enterprise to thrive in a volatile environment in the long term by creating sustainable shared value (environmental, societal, economic, financial) for all stakeholders. The focus on transforming and simultaneously performing is described as “transformance™.” Air Date: 08/31/2023 | Time Slot: 12:30 p.m. ET Dr. Sarmann Kennedyd has more than 20 years of experience in business process reengineering, information technology systems development, managing complex projects, and data analysis.

MIMS later became the Global Leadership MBA program, which is now the Customized Online MBA. In 2015, the Jindal School dedicated a room in the Executive Education area, JSOM 1.502, in Dr. Guisinger’s memory. The dedication coincided with GLEMBA efforts to become more engaging and relevant in the post-global financial crisis economy.

Students can convert their research into one or more whitepapers to signal thought leadership. * DBUA 732* is a three-credit course ** DBUA 7V26 is a nine-credit course In all cases, the course description is followed by an indication of the approximate number of contact hours per week in a semester for any lecture and/or laboratory components of the course; for example, (2-4) indicates two contact hours of lecture and four contact hours of laboratory per week. At the end of each course description, a frequency of course offering code is available: Students will progress through the program by completing their coursework in the following sequence. Note: “SCH” indicates Semester Credit Hours At the end of Year Two, students will be admitted to candidacy based on classroom performance and the development of case studies and research projects. ** Students will register for dissertation in the Fall, Spring and Summer of the Year Three Students will develop a case study related to the topic of their dissertation. This case study should identify a complex business issue, propose a solution(s) using advanced research methodologies and discuss the implementation of the solution(s). The purpose of the case study is to educate undergraduate and graduate-level students with real-life business problems and their solutions. After completing their coursework, DBA candidates will write a dissertation thesis that studies a real-world, business-relevant problem, its solution and implementation. Ideally, DBA students should be able to implement these solutions within their affiliated organizations. Through this thesis, students will demonstrate their depth of practice-based research knowledge. A good quality thesis should be written at such a level of rigor and interest that it can be published in a top practice-oriented journal. The thesis could relate to any one of the traditional business areas (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Organizational Strategy, International Management, Marketing, Information Systems and Operations Management) or span multiple disciplines. One or more faculty will guide the candidate in preparing and writing the dissertation. Before you apply, get familiar with the application process for the UT Dallas Executive DBA program."

Please contact Andrew Davis with any questions or inquiries. Professor Gaur’s research interests lie in retail operations and supply chain management, including topics such as inventory management, product variety, distribution logistics, and linking operations to financial performance. He conducts empirical research in inventories using aggregate firm-level and proprietary data to assess performance improvement of firms, improve demand forecasting, and identify the drivers of inventory turnover. He also conducts theoretical research in inventories to study the relationship of stocking policies with product variety, consumer choice behavior, competition, and financial considerations such as hedging, growth and bankruptcy risk. Gaur was awarded the Clifford H. Whitcomb Faculty Fellowship in 2010-2011, the Johnson Core Faculty Award by the graduating class of 2008 and 2013, the Wickham Skinner Early Career Research Accomplishments Award by the Production and Operations Management Society in 2006, and honorable mention in the George B. Dantzig Dissertation Award Competition in 2001. His paper “Hedging Inventory Risk Through Market Instruments” (co-authored with professor Sridhar Seshadri, The University of Texas at Austin), published in MSOM, received the 2008 MSOM Best Paper Award. He serves as a department editor for Management Science and the Production and Operations Management journal, as well as associate editor for Manufacturing and Service Operations Management. Since coming to Johnson in 1991, Professor Bloomfield has used laboratory experiments to examine the effects of financial market regulations on investor welfare, and to explore how psychological forces can alter the behavior of financial markets. Bloomfield is the founding director of the Financial Accounting Standards Research Initiative (FASRI). FASRI, an activity of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, uses a blog and weekly online round-table discussions to foster communication between academic researchers and accounting standard setters, and conducts and supports studies that can assist the FASB in its deliberations. Bloomfield is an editor of Accounting, Organizations and Society, and he serves on the editorial boards of a number of peer-reviewed journals, including The Accounting Review, Journal of Accounting and Economics, and Journal of Accounting Research. Bloomfield is an advocate for serious uses of virtual worlds for education and distance collaboration. He hosts the weekly Metanomics event series in Second Life, which explores business and policy aspects of new technology. Bloomfield’s virtual-world activities have been covered extensively in the media, from BusinessWeek and The New York Times to CFO Magazine, Technology Review. This workshop is designed for PhD students and faculty new to Behavioral Operations, but it is open to ALL interested conference participants. It will consist of tutorials by experts in behavioral research followed by focused discussion groups for students to receive feedback on early- and mid-stage research. Tutorials this year will be given by Elena Katok (Jindal School of Management, ) and Stephen Leider (Ross School of Business, University of Michigan).

This year, our keynote speaker is George Wu, from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. George Wu studies the psychology of individual, managerial and organizational decision-making; decision analysis; and cognitive biases in bargaining and negotiation. Additionally, he has received research funding as part of a three-year, $3.6 million project titled “Enhancing the Human Experience through Behavioral Science: New Paths to Purpose,” to advance the behavioral science of purpose. Project research explores how people adopt, pursue and fulfill their intentions to accomplish something that is meaningful to the self, and often is of consequence to the world beyond the self. Wu’s research has been published widely in a number of journals in economics, management science and psychology, including Cognitive Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, Management Science, Psychological Science and the Quarterly Journal of Economic. Prior to joining the Chicago Booth faculty in 1997, Wu was on the faculty of Harvard Business School as an assistant and associate professor in the managerial economics area and then in the negotiation and decision-making group. He also has worked as a lecturer at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to graduate school, Wu worked as a decision analyst at Procter & Gamble. Wu is a former department editor of Management Science and is on numerous other editorial boards, including Decision Analysis, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, Journal of Risk and Uncertainty and Theory and Decision. He earned a bachelor’s degree cum laude in applied mathematics with a concentration in decision and control in 1985, a master’s degree in applied mathematics in 1987 and a PhD in decision sciences in 1991, all from Harvard University. In addition, Elena Katok, from the Naveen Jindal School of Management at UT Dallas, will lead us in a hands-on activity on laboratory experiments using exciting new software, SoPHIE. Katok is a pioneer in the growing field of behavioral operations management. She helped establish the Behavioral Operations Management section of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences and has also served as its president. She also co-organized the first Behavioral Research in Operations Management conference, which was established in 2006. Besides behavioral operations management, Katok’s research expertise includes market design and strategic procurement. Her research has been published in top business and economics journals, including Management Science, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, and Production and Operations Management.

The buyer renaissance fueled by information technology has changed how prospective students want to learn about programs. Our marketing approaches need to reflect these changes and this session will provide you 2 examples of how to change your marketing approach. Brette Matherne, Georgia State University 10:45 am to 12:00 pm JSOM 1.502 University websites have not changed much in the last decade – geared toward delivering information more than making a creating a positive selling experience. We will look at the transition of the DePaul University MBA website and how an outside organization was able to measure its effectiveness. We will also look forward at the mind of the millennial (and beyond) and how we can think about the process by which youth gathers information and makes decisions. Lisa Shatz, Christa Hinton, DePaul University 10:45 am to 12:00 pm JSOM 1.606 Designed in partnership with selective business schools from around the world, the Executive Assessment launched in 2016 and is currently accepted by 38 schools globally. The Executive Assessment was designed specifically for Working Professionals applying to Executive MBA programs and is currently used by Executive MBA, Executive Masters, and PTMBA programs to quickly assess the business school readiness of their candidates. Since PTMBA programs and their candidates often face similar challenges as Executive MBA programs and their candidates, the EA has been made available to PTMBA programs to use in their admissions process since the beginning of 2018. The assessment is comprised of three short 30-minute sections, requires light preparation, and its results are highly correlated to classroom performance. Learn more about the new Executive Assessment and hear directly from UC Berkeley and UCLA about their experiences using the EA. Manish Dharia, Graduate Management Admission Council Majorie DeGraca, University of California, Berkeley Dylan Stafford, University of California, Los Angeles 10:45 am to 12:00 pm JSOM 1.517 This presentation will describe the efforts undertaken to build stronger links between the Full-Time, Evening & Weekend and the MBA for Executives program – from Admissions through jointly offered electives to student experience events – to improve the quality of all programs while increasing efficiency of running these three top ten MBA programs. Mark Gorenflo, University of California, Berkeley Rahul Sampat, University of California, Berkeley 12:15 pm to 1:30 pm Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom 1:45 pm to 3:00 pm JSOM 1.508 As it becomes more challenging to attract PMBA students, schools must be both innovative and flexible in providing a worthwhile student experience and education. With employer reimbursement on the decline, PMBA students now largely pay for these programs. As such, student expectations move well beyond attending classes and taking exams. The session will feature brief presentations of PMBA-specific GMAC data, approaches for understanding student needs, as well as examples of program innovations in the areas of community building, program flexibility and delivery, and career management. The session will conclude with a healthy Q&A. Phil Miller, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Gonzalo Frexies, University of California, Los Angeles Joe Stephens, The University of Texas at Austin Megan Bryne Krueger, Northwestern University 1:45 pm to 3:00 pm JSOM 1.517 Change! Innovate! Hurry! Chicken Little and a House On Fire! We have heard these same alarm bells at many conferences. Great-but “So what? What now?” In this interactive session, we move the needle on the need to change by presenting the theories of innovation and disruption, offering practical insights from industry and education, and giving you the opportunity to workshop directly with peers. Prepare to break into power-teams for engaging sleeves-up collaboration. We’ll come back in plenary and share our best ideas, and send you each back to your institution with a plan to go forward this year. Toby McChesney, Santa Clara University Nydia MacGregor, Santa Clara University David Cook, Old Dominion University Dylan Stafford, University of California, Los Angeles 1:45 pm to 3:00 pm JSOM 1.606 Engaging students in PMBA and O-MBA programs is sometimes challenging. By collaborating across platforms, university colleges, and the broader community, a school can expand the opportunities for success. Examples to maximize these synergies include leveraging international trips, Student Associations, and networking opportunities across platforms. Collaboration can occur not only within the b-school, but across the campus. For example, b-schools can win recognition on campus or find support for their contributions to community engagement efforts, such as contributing to the attainment of the Carnegie Engaged Campus classification or receiving faculty grants. Pamela Jorden, University of Arizona Crystal Adams, University of Arizona Deborah Cours, California State University Northridge Deborah Heisley, California State University Northridge 1:45 pm to 3:00 pm JSOM 1.502 University websites have not changed much in the last decade – geared toward delivering information more than making a creating a positive selling experience.

Traditionally, ROI has been a simple financial equation, but what if getting the MBA is less about financial gain in the future and more about satisfaction, purposefulness, or work/life balance as the lead variable in the equation? How will your school communicate the value of the MBA in more relevant ways to new generations? For those primarily financially-driven, how will the new Career Services and Employer Alliance Standards (CSEA) part-time reporting standards help your school tell your story? Join us for a lively discussion with several break-outs to swap ideas with your peers. Jillian Melton, Southern Methodist University Kathleen Edwards, Emory University Kara Fichthorn,University of Washington 3:30 pm – 4:45 pm JSOM 1.517 This presentation will describe the efforts undertaken to build stronger links between the Full-Time, Evening & Weekend and the MBA for Executives program – from Admissions through jointly offered electives to student experience events – to improve the quality of all programs while increasing efficiency of running these three top ten MBA programs. Mark Gorenflo, University of California, Berkeley Rahul Sampat, University of California, Berkeley 3:30 pm to 4:45 pm JSOM 1.606 This session provides a variety of perspectives on strategic decisions involved in bringing programs online. Panelists represent schools that are big and small, public and private, and used online partners to varying degrees. Learn about what they’re doing now and, more importantly, how they got there.

It will then drill into the consequences and implications for the reskilling of the global workforce and the MBA. Sharing a framework for the deconstruction of jobs and the redeployment of work, we will explore the implications for work, organizations, rewards and education. Ravin Jesuthasan, Willis Towers Watson 9:45 am to 10:15am JSOM 1.516 & EDR Reception 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.508 Students are increasingly concerned with social justice and the creation of value in their communities. A course on professional identity and political economy—or modules from those areas inserted in other courses—can help students to connect their business education, their workplace roles, and the creation of value through the practice of the noble profession of business. This session will describe content used in multiple iterations of an elective MBA level course and point to practical ways to access and incorporate this content in standalone modules and/or existing courses. Matthew Phillips, Wake Forest University 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.502 We will share the Simon Business School’s approach to developing students with high EQ while meeting the educational needs of their analytical and quantitative minds. By raising awareness of diverse communication styles, students can better collaborate beyond just articulating facts. They will be prepared to understand their listener, and learn how to be heard in an academic or work team environment. Attendees will receive a sample of materials our students work through at orientation, and will participate in an interactive team building activity as a sample of this learning brought to life. Janet Mejias, University of Rochester 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.517 In the past two years, UC Irvine’s Merage School and William & Mary’s Mason School of Business launched successful new hybrid and online MBA programs, respectively, to meet marketplace demand. This session will review the design and implementation strategies for both successful programs, as well as key insights into the faculty “buy-in process,” and managing student expectations. The session will also review “lessons learned” and predictions for the future of hybrid and online MBA programs. Jon Masciana, University of California, Irvine Pamela Suzadail, College of William & Mary 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.606 Have you considered working with an external partner to launch your online MBA or other online program? Each of our panelists has worked with one (or several) external partners and will share their experiences here. In addition to our brief presentations, we’ll save time for Q&A. Judy Frels, University of Maryland Amy Foster, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Arshad Saiyed, University of Illinois Stephen Taylor, Arizona State University 11:45 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom Monica Powell, 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom 12:20 pm"

    "text": "On behalf of the faculty, staff and students of the UT Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management, I want to extend our warmest welcome to all participants coming to our school to attend the 2018 Part-Time MBA (PMBA) Conference. It is an honor to host the conference as it celebrates its 25th anniversary. Throughout these years, PMBA conferees have focused on sharing new ideas, best practices and hopes for improvement. In meeting annually, the conference has served to build a strong nationwide network of MBA colleagues who have established a strong alliance on behalf of better education. I am confident 2018 PMBA will once again play an important role in spurring research, encouraging continuous program improvement and providing excellent opportunities to build more and better collaborations between colleagues. The scope of this event, The PMBA of the Future and The Future of the PMBA, provides a unique meeting ground for program decision-makers to forge emerging ideas and move forward in ever-changing PMBA landscape. I am confident that over these three days, new partnerships, stronger alliances and even more cooperative relationships will result. I thank all the distinguished invited speakers for their presence and contributions to the conference. I also thank the advisory board members for their efforts in ensuring a rigorous review process to select high quality presentations. Dr. Hasan Pirkul, Dean and Caruth Chair of Management"

B-school deans, professors and administrators convening at the Naveen Jindal School of Management Oct. 1 will contemplate Jetson to Jedi questions at two conferences exploring the future of professional (part-time) MBA and online MBA programs. Nearly 200 conferees from 101 universities are coming for the 25th annual Part-Time MBA — PMBA — Conference or the second annual Online MBA — OMBA — Conference — or both. The conference overlap, with the PMBA meeting convening Oct. 1 and Oct. 2, and Online MBA Conference meetings beginning Oct. 2 and continuing until noon of the next day. Both conferences have a forward view, with an eye to keeping the landscape of an MBA education relevant and useful to working professionals seeking the degree online or part-time. The PMBA Conference theme is “The PMBA of the Future and the Future of the PMBA.” The OMBA Conference theme is “Keeping Pace with the Future.” Both meetings acknowledge that technology is changing work and its rewards at an increasingly rapid pace. As they have changed, so have student expectations. Those seeking degrees today want and anticipate an educational experience very different from their counterparts of even a decade ago. Looking at the future from the student vantage, conferees will consider how schools can be innovative and flexible in providing a worthwhile student experience and education. Conferees also will address the concerns of students today with social justice and their role in their communities. One session also will address how to develop students with high emotional quotients while at the same time meeting the educational needs of their analytical and quantitative minds. Keep up with both conferences on social media at #FutureofMBA."

For the first time in 26 years, we will present aggregated admissions and enrollment data from nearly 100 schools who are participating and attending this conference. This data will help us understand the current demand for our programs; how Covid-19 affected applications, enrollment and program delivery; whether women and under-represented minorities number have increased; and what the future may hold for the programs we lead. The analysis will provide a rich understanding of our programs and what we think may or may not happen in the future. 11:15 a.m. – 12:15 p.m. The GMAT/GRE requirement: Is it still necessary for PMBA/OMBA Admissions? Stephanie Geisler, Director MBA, University of Utah Kellee Scott, Director of Admissions, University of Southern California Jen Arthur, Director of Admissions, North Carolina State University Kimberly Winchell, Director of Recruitment, University of Arizona Session Recording Description The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a trend toward waiving GMAT/GRE tests in the PMBA/OMBA admissions process. As GMAT/GRE exams become more available and online assessments more reliable, will this trend toward waiving the exams reverse, or is there no going back?

What unconventional methods have schools moved to where we can still give that personal touch?

The panel will provide insights into the changes they have already made to deliver quality, accessible content, and in addition how these changes might have long-term strategic impacts on our MBA programs. Finally, we will discuss what curriculum or format changes might still need to happen in the future based on what we have learned in 2020 about content delivery adjustments, providing flexibility for students, and keeping our community safe. Student Wants vs Needs… at what point does customer service go too far? Mia Hawlk, Director of Part-Time MBA, University of Connecticut Crystal Adams, Senior Director of MBA Innovation and Student Experience, Arizona State University Eric Hamberger, Managing Director of Online Programs, Villanova University Helaine Korn (Moderator), Executive Director of Graduate Programs, Baruch College Session Recording Description Students have always pushed the boundaries of how far their faculty and administrators should go to make them happy. With the perception that students are getting a “lower quality of deliverable” due to the quickness with which classes, specifically, and other components of the educational experience, more generally, converted to alternate modalities, we will discuss how our institutions are managing student expectations. Attendees of this session will be asked: “ When does customer service infringe on the integrity of our program? Has the customer service model gone too far? How will we continue to navigate some of these difficult questions post –COVID 19?” This will be an interactive conference session; please come prepared to share your student services experiences.

It will then drill into the consequences and implications for the reskilling of the global workforce and the MBA. Sharing a framework for the deconstruction of jobs and the redeployment of work, we will explore the implications for work, organizations, rewards and education. Ravin Jesuthasan, Willis Towers Watson 9:45 am to 10:15am JSOM 1.516 & EDR Reception 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.508 Students are increasingly concerned with social justice and the creation of value in their communities. A course on professional identity and political economy—or modules from those areas inserted in other courses—can help students to connect their business education, their workplace roles, and the creation of value through the practice of the noble profession of business. This session will describe content used in multiple iterations of an elective MBA level course and point to practical ways to access and incorporate this content in standalone modules and/or existing courses Matthew Phillips, Wake Forest University 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.502 We will share the Simon Business School’s approach to developing students with high EQ while meeting the educational needs of their analytical and quantitative minds. By raising awareness of diverse communication styles, students can better collaborate beyond just articulating facts. They will be prepared to understand their listener, and learn how to be heard in an academic or work team environment. Attendees will receive a sample of materials our students work through at orientation, and will participate in an interactive team building activity as a sample of this learning brought to life. Janet Mejias, University of Rochester 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.517 In the past two years, UC Irvine’s Merage School and William & Mary’s Mason School of Business launched successful new hybrid and online MBA programs, respectively, to meet marketplace demand. This session will review the design and implementation strategies for both successful programs, as well as key insights into the faculty “buy-in process,” and managing student expectations. The session will also review “lessons learned” and predictions for the future of hybrid and online MBA programs. Jon Masciana, University of California, Irvine Pamela Suzadail, College of William & Mary 10:15 am to 11:30 am JSOM 1.606 Have you considered working with an external partner to launch your online MBA or other online program? Each of our panelists has worked with one (or several) external partners and will share their experiences here. In addition to our brief presentations, we’ll save time for Q&A. Judy Frels, University of Maryland Arshad Saiyed, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Amy Foster, University of Illinois Stephen Taylor, Arizona State University 11:45 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom Monica Powell, 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom 1:15 pm to 2:30 pm JSOM 1.508 Services This session will provide an overview of the major operational components of a successful online MBA program. The discussion will include implementation of an online orientation program, providing tailored student services for this unique population, and guiding students towards their post-MBA careers. Whether your school is planning to launch an online MBA program in the near future or already managing an established successful program, this session will provide a forum for participants to share best practices and potential challenges in the introduction and management of online MBA programs. Janin Menendez, University of Florida Valerie Henry, Temple University Stacey Dorang Peeler, Pennsylvania State University 1:15 pm to 2:30 pm JSOM 1.502 Colleges and Universities often turn to vendor partnerships in their hesitation to assume complete risk associated with launching an online program in an unfamiliar market. As that program matures, so too does the knowledge and expertise of institutional faculty and staff. And that maturation ultimately forces each institution to answer two critical questions: Do the for-profit motivations of our vendor partner align with the priorities of our non-profit institution? Can we continue to grow our online program on our own? This session will outline one institution’s struggle with answering those questions, and how those answers became the catalyst for developing a new strategy aimed at reaffirming their identity. Eric Hamberger, Villanova University Claire Bruno, Villanova University Marie Witman, Villanova University 1:15 pm to 2:30 pm JSOM 1.517 Academic Integrity in an online MBA program can quickly turn into an ‘arms race’, with students learning new ways to exploit technology for unethical purposes, and faculty/administrators adopting new technology to hinder such exploitations. Our mission, however, is to go boldly where at least many others have not yet gone, exploring new and more comprehensive approaches to promoting ethical attitudes throughout OMBA programs. This session specifically addresses best practices for embedding the ABCs of academic integrity into your program: affect, behavior, and cognition. Michelle Darnell, Pennsylvania State University 2:30 pm to 3:00 pm JSOM 1.516 & EDR Reception 3:00 pm to 4:15 pm JSOM 1.508 Two leading universities, with in-house production teams, will present two different approaches to designing an online MBA curriculum. Ramesh Venkataraman, Indiana University Sandra Chrystal, University of Southern California Phil Griego, University of Southern California 3:00 pm to 4:15 pm JSOM 1.502 What does it take to launch and deliver a successful online program? What are the different elements to consider? How do you get the most out of new technologies? In this lecture, professors Gafo and Rojo will examine the key components to be bear in mind when designing and implementing a top online program, and how to integrate them successfully. The session will review the process of designing and setting up the WoW Room at IE and explain the role of different stakeholders (faculty, program management, learning innovation team, etc.) in doing so. Laura Rojo, IE University Ignacio Gafo, IE University 3:00 pm to 4:15 pm JSOM 1.517 The Imperial College Business School Global MBA is now in its four year of delivery and is going from strength to strength. The programme was launched in response to a growing demand by students around the world to learn online, primarily due to ease of the format and its accessibility. Since launching the Global Online MBA programme at Imperial College Business School, we have seen a growth of 30% in applications each year. This growth has been realized with a rising number of high-quality applications from applicants around the world. We will discuss the origins of the MBA, strategic and organic growth in recruitment, and the future of the programme. Gavin Symmonds, Imperial College Phil Carter, Imperial College 4:30 pm 7:50 am 8:30 am to 9:45 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom In this session, led by Assistant Dean for the W. P. Carey School at Arizona State University, participants will be challenged to think broadly about change and innovation, and how risk, market, and context play critical roles in the success or failure of changes. This roundtable workshop gives attendees at the Online MBA Conference an opportunity to move twice during the workshop to participate in two innovation generation exercises. Table topic leaders will engage attendees to brainstorm innovative ideas that solve real problems within Online MBA programs. Topics will include: Hybrid Programs – PMBA/EMBA, Online Student Services, Curriculum Design, Growing Enrollment, Online Student Engagement, Social Media, Marketing Online, and Residencies. Stephen Taylor, Arizona State University 9:45 am to 10:15 am JSOM 1.516 & EDR Reception 10:15 am to 11:30 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom A In-person experiences are an important part of online learning. They provide students an opportunity to network and strengthen relationships with their peers, while also allowing them to feel a greater connection to the program and school. Leaders from universities who are doing this in creative and exciting ways will discuss why immersions are so important to their programs and how they successfully plan and implement them. The panel will discuss topics such as locations, staffing, and balancing an effective learning experience while allowing for “white space”, where students can network and explore the location on their own. Amy McHale, Syracuse University Amy Foster, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 10:15 am to 11:30 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom B This session focuses on recent news stories and emerging trends that have the potential of forcing program managers to change their program’s strategy, structure, and curriculum. The overall goal is to offer insight into how graduate management education is changing and how part-time and online MBA programs managers and faculty will need to adjust to those changes. Rodney Alsup, MBA News Digest 10:15 am to 11:30 am Davidson Gundy Alumni Center Ballroom C This session explains the process our team followed to create an online teaching certification customized to the University’s faculty community, and covers the life cycle of the program including conceptualization, design, pilot runs and mid-course corrections, content creation/ sourcing, delivery and participant experience.

In addition, students may choose to complete graduate coursework that applies only to their undergraduate degree or their future graduate degree. To be approved for any of these options, students must meet the requirements outlined below as well as abide by the complete policy outlined in the Catalog. Students can complete graduate JSOM courses if they meet the following requirements: Students can be granted conditional approval for the Fast-Track Program if they are completing the requirements at UTD during the current semester. Students that are given conditional approval but fail to satisfy the above requirements will no longer be eligible to participate in the Fast-Track Program and will be dropped from currently enrolled fast-track courses in the upcoming semester. Once in the program, if at any time a student fails to satisfy these requirements, they will be dropped from any future graduate coursework (if they had been approved to pre-register). Additionally, a student who selected the fast-track option will be withdrawn from the Fast-Track Program. Applications will be accepted for all three options starting: To apply, students will need to submit the JSOM Fast-Track Application. At the time of registration, the student must declare how each approved graduate course will apply to their undergraduate/graduate degree by choosing one of the three options from the table below (Option A, B or C). Once applied, the choice cannot be changed. If completing more than one graduate course, the student can choose a different option for each course. If choosing a combination of the three options, students can only complete an overall maximum of 15 hours. (15 hours includes any repeated or withdrawn coursework) * To be admitted to either the Full-Time MBA or the Professional Evening Cohort MBA, students need to make an application and visit the MBA Program Office.

It is strongly recommended you Google the vendor name and the word “scam” as the search criteria. Also, research organizations and potential scams through Glassdoor, the Better Business Bureau, and/or Career Insider powered by Vault (a CMC subscription resource available with NetID verification).

All JSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that demonstrates the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. JSOM has established a mandatory code of conduct and ethics policy for students. Failure to follow the policy guidelines will result in significant negative consequences as outlined below. 1 Communicate an accurate and truthful representation of your academic and professional accomplishments, skills, and work authorization to employers on your application materials, resume and throughout the interview and recruitment process. 2 Students are expected to fulfill their commitment to attend a scheduled in-person, phone or video interview and to interview genuinely. A verbal, written, email, text or other communication that expresses your acceptance of an internship or job offer is a commitment. Upon acceptance of the offer, cancel any upcoming interviews, withdraw pending applications, and notify other employers that you are no longer a candidate. Note that reneging (backing out) of an internship/job offer is unprofessional and damages not only your professional reputation but also the university. Finally, follow through with your commitment to the established work schedule and the start and end dates of employment. Quitting a job or internship early or unexpectedly has negative consequences for the employer. 3 Note that violating company policies, engaging in Illegal activities or inappropriate/unprofessional behavior may result in employment termination in addition to the JSOM Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy consequences. DVC informatics Analyst at Houlihan Lokey I chose my MS degree in Finance at JSOM primarily because of the curriculum and the faculty staff.

The program involves developing defined market research and other market entry strategies for companies domiciled outside the USA that have a goal of entering the USA market and equipping students with the necessary skills to succeed and navigate the complex global business environment. The foreign Companies that are able to take advantage of this program is limited since we have a limited number of Students. Candidate Companies will be required to go through an evaluation process up to six weeks prior to the start of the spring and fall semesters before being accepted into the program. To apply, the Company should submit an application. The Jindal School of Management at offers nine Bachelor of Science degree programs (all requiring 120 semester credit hours) and prepares students for the world of business and best practices. These nine Bachelor of Science programs are listed in the left and top navigation menus. I am currently the Program Lead for the Global Development Initiative – part of the Center for Global Business within the Naveen Jindal School of Business, University of Texas at Dallas. My Company, HOWORTH International, specializes in advising and supporting companies in their international market entry initiatives, and through our work with these companies we recruit and onboard companies each semester to be included in the GDI program. In addition to recruiting these companies, I provide mentorship to both the students and the companies as they develop US market research for those companies. Periodically, we develop opportunities for both students and the client companies in the form of follow-on research, internship, and employment opportunities. The Global Development Initiative consistently delivers key market research and valuable market entry advice for client companies as they consider entering the large and attractive USA market. International-based companies applying for the GDI Program submit an Indication of Interest and are evaluated for acceptance to the GDI Program based on specific requirements Each company that is selected is then assigned a team of 3-5 students with one student assigned as the Team Leader. In addition, an experienced C-level business executive is assigned to the team as a Business Mentor and a senior student who is experienced with the program will be assigned to the team as a Coordinator. At the beginning of each semester, the students, mentor, and coordinator are introduced to the selected company and its executives and assigned liaison staff. This becomes the GDI Team. The market research project scope is defined and agreed through a Scope of Work and the GDI Team begins their work together with attending in-class lectures in the IMS 4350 Global Market Entry Strategies class. The GOAL for the GDI Team is to deliver high value to support the company’s market entry plan into the United States market. The scope will include researching market information related to the company’s goods or services, competitive landscape, project/service localization and introduction to individuals and organizations helpful in supporting the company’s market entry strategy. Weekly meetings and progress reports are arranged between the Companies and their GDI Teams.

    "text": "The Global Sustainability Experience at UT Dallas brings awareness and excitement to the sustainability by providing a forum for academic and industry partners to discuss sustainability trends, generate sustainable business ideas and engage students in developing innovative approaches and potential solutions to critical global issues. In the last few decades, international business organizations and academic institutions have been focusing on emerging countries’ economies. Among them, Rwanda has been featured as one of the most attractive countries in Africa. Through group projects, company study tours and discussion with university faculty members and government officials, students will be able to learn about the business opportunities and challenges that exist in emerging countries. The course helps students assess the business environments and sustainability efforts in Africa by conducting the study as a seminar in Kigali, Rwanda. This webinar was a kickoff event for our annual Sustainability Competition in April 2023. The inaugural Global Sustainability Experience at the Naveen Jindal School of Management — a semester long event that included two webinars, two workshops and a student pitch competition — concluded with a celebration that coincided with Earth Day. Dr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, introduced Dr. Muhammad Yunus, the morning keynote speaker. Before the introduction, Pirkul spoke about the role that business schools play in society, especially regarding sustainability. The Naveen Jindal School of Management kicked off its inaugural 2022 Sustainability Competition with a webinar that focused on how innovation and entrepreneurship can be applied to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to help solve sustainability problems. The competition is a collaboration of the Sustainable Global Business Initiative in the Center for Global Business, the Center for Information Technology and Management, and two student organizations: the Society of Sustainable Business and the Consulting Leadership & Development Society. was recently accepted as a member of the UN Academic Impact in November 2021.

    "title": "Fraud Summit  IAEP",
    "text": "The Fraud Summit, put on annually by the Jindal School’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, gathers professionals interested in the latest trends in fraud schemes and fraud prevention. The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. Well over 500 people attended the March 22 conference and nearly 300 participated in the workshop the day before. Case in point was a presentation by Leah Wietholter, CEO and founder of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Workman Forensics, who shared the case studies of fraudsters “Bill” and “Scott.” Like an involving Agatha Christie novel, Wietholter laid out a mystery for the auditors to unravel, stretching their logic muscles to figure out clues of the crime. Entertaining and interactive, Bill’s story she dubbed “The Case of the Mancave” and Scott’s “The Case of the Sneaky CFO.” “For the first case, Bill has limited access and could write checks and could hide,” she said after her presentation. “Scott, he could do anything he wanted. He could issue checks to himself, use credit cards. Because he had access to so many things, he could steal in a variety of ways.” Wietholter, who is the author of the book Data Sleuth: Using Data in Forensic Accounting Engagements and Fraud Investigations, said the stories are for accountants’ and internal auditors’ understanding of where the best evidence can come from. “If there is a case of fraud at a company, I wanted to show them how to have vision and not just for finding internal documents,” she said. Wietholter believes there are multiple advantages to learning through these cases. “We remember stories,” she said. “And if you don’t remember all of it, you’ll at least remember the person who told it. And then you have a resource to call up. Listen to stories, connect with stories, it will make you better.” As has been a regular practice of the Summit, someone who committed fraud themselves shared their story. Previous speakers include Frank Abagnale, his exploits and rehabilitation made famous in Steven Spielberg’s film Catch Me if You Can. This year audience members heard the story of Tipper X, otherwise known as Tom Hardin, who explained how he got involved in insider trading and ultimately worked with the FBI when it came to others involved in criminal activities. He explained how he committed his crime but also the aftermath, the limitation of employment, the shame he felt, the effect on people in his life and how he resurrected his life. “I always tell people if you ever got to that line, just think about who might be impacted if you were to cross over,” he said. Anthony Pugliese, president and CEO of the Institute of Internal Auditors, gave an outlook for the profession. From the data collected, he said the expectation is that artificial intelligence will continue to grow, that a focus should be on looking at its generating of misinformation and disinformation and an action to take for the industry is to upscale in AI. Other actions to take include preparing for new Global Internal Audit Standards. “Strengthen training and awareness to combat cyber attacks…” he said. “…Hand in glove with the AI, but it’s going to become more and more difficult. Proactively broach emerging topics and risks with the board. One of the most, I think, debated parts of our new global standards are governing the internal audit function and you’ll see in that required communications with the board…And then create a portfolio of policies, procedures and best practice for responsible AI implementation. And that could be just starting with saying, ‘Is the board aware and proactively engaged in what we’re doing with AI within the company?’” Wietholter also gave a talk, offering another fraud story example, this one “The Case of the Cash Back Payroll Scheme.” This included overpayments of payroll to several employees and allowed a chance to delve into investigative priorities. Mauriello said a hallmark of the conference and workshops is the experiential aspect. “It’s not so easy just to go out and be a professional skeptic,” said Mauriello, who estimates the conference has had around 12,000 attendees over the years. He shared with the audience that proceeds from the event go to benefit the scholarships and endowment for the CIAE. “You think through how things work in real life, setting up these cases, giving you that real-life experience,” he said. “This work can be very much thinking outside of the box and auditors and accounting can get trapped in everything being a checklist. The interest is there for our conference because people know this is a high-demand skill set.” Mark Salamasick, the founder of the Summit and former director of the CIAE, pointed out how students can possibly get jobs just from working the event, one that attracts members from some of the largest accounting firms in the country to attend. “Students can possibly change their lives by being a part of this event,” he said. “First, they get exposed to this kind of employment in a different way and see the excitement of it and the skills it takes. This event can be just as valuable, or even more valuable, than going to the usual meet-and-greets with companies also. Companies like to meet students in a different kind of setting than that. They can see the professionalism of our students, and get a sense of what kind of people they are. Many students have benefited from being a part of the event…It’s also a great chance for companies to see our campus who may not have had a chance to and to understand better what the business school is doing. It’s one thing to hear about the business school, it’s another thing to see it.” Brad Holloway, an internal auditor at Parkland Hospital, said he appreciated how the event can expand your thinking. “You get insulated as an internal auditor in your own organization and own department,” he said. “You learn how people do things in their own organizations and you can take it back with you. It’s easier to stay engaged with the stories in sessions of real-life situations. It helps you learn in another way and you relate on a different level. People don’t realize how challenging our jobs are. It’s a good reminder and shows you how to think more critically in your position.” Michael Khoury, chief operations officer at Texas Life Insurance Company, also appreciates how the stories brought lessons to life. “I think the most valuable part of the conference is it gives people in our profession examples of how people steal money, the process of trying to discover their actions and you gain much from spending time going through the examples,” he said. “I’ve been to this conference multiple times and always come away with something valuable. You get former criminals that come here and they explain how they did it and why they did it. Those working in fraud get to have a better understanding. And it always starts with opportunity. It’s also about learning internal controls that could be better. Criminals figure out poor internal controls and come up with a plan. This can help us when it comes to crime.” Angela Wilkinson, a staff auditor at Army and Air Force Exchange Service, said that a positive aspect of the Summit came from different levels of positions being in attendance. “I think a major strength of the conference is that it brings people from all different backgrounds and industries together, but they share the same need,” she said. “We’re here to make things better.”"

The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. What do Scott Sullivan, Andrew Fastow and Mark Swartz all have in common? Before these once-prominent chief financial officers became convicted felons, all three had been named “CFO of the Year” by CFO magazine in the late 1990s. “These CFOs were not chosen by CFO magazine, but by a survey of their peers. So it wasn’t just the average people who didn’t see what was coming,” said Neil Weinberg, senior Forbes magazine editor. “It was also interesting that this was a contest for ‘CFO of the Year’ that was sponsored by Arthur Andersen.” Weinberg addressed about 350 professionals in the internal auditing field who attended the 2008 UT Dallas Fraud Summit on March 28. Co-sponsored by UT Dallas School of Management’s Internal Auditing Education Program, the conference featured a cross-section of government and law enforcement representatives who covered key issues involving economic crime, including money laundering and Internet crime, as well as the latest fraud schemes and fraud prevention techniques. Drawing on his recently published book, Stolen Without A Gun, a look at white-collar crime that he co-wrote with convicted embezzler Walter Pavlo Jr., Weinberg discussed why tough new laws, heavy spending and countermeasures aimed at stamping out corporate crime have been unsuccessful. Nationwide, fraud losses amount to approximately $630 billion a year – more than the United States has spent in five years in Iraq, Weinberg told the audience. Corporate crime has actually increased since the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which Congress passed in hopes of upgrading corporate accountability in the aftermath of the Enron scandal, Weinberg said. Of the companies taking part in a recent Pricewaterhouse Coopers survey, about half reported corporate fraud in the past year, he said. “These are not nice times. These are scary, historic times. What we have witnessed in the last week or two we have not witnessed since the Great Depression,” Weinberg said. “We have seen this year for the first time since the Great Depression a national decline in housing prices. “Right now we’ve obviously gone from boom to bust, and my theory on fraud, busts and bubbles is that they’re inextricably linked. And while we have fraud at all times in all places, the real big ugly ones tend to come out at times like this,” he said. Bull markets make heroes; bear markets make crooks, he said. When times are good, people suspend good judgment, and when fraud is uncovered, “people come up with reasons why it wasn’t their fault,” said Weinberg, who has profiled corporate, mutual fund and pension scandals and has covered financial markets for many years. Triggers to fraud, he said, include unrealistic expectations, the tone at the top of the company, rationalization and opportunity. Stolen Without a Gun illustrates this point with Pavlo’s story. A fast-tracker who pleaded guilty to siphoning off $6 million as a debt collector for MCI Communications, Pavlo and colleagues cooked up a scheme in which they persuaded troubled clients to pay a bogus financing firm in the Cayman Islands to cover their MCI debts while Pavlo secretly erased them from his employer’s books. A seemingly ordinary, well-educated, mid-management employee, Pavlo illustrates the reality about the white collar scandals that have occurred since and are breaking news almost every day, Weinberg said. Weinberg suggested that to deter fraud, companies must set the proper tone at the top, offer appropriate compensation and training and embrace tougher consequences for those caught. “People often ask me what the answer is, and unfortunately, there’s no magic bullet, but I do think the tone at the top is very important. … This type of crime doesn’t happen in a nunnery. It happens in a certain type of corporate environment,” Weinberg said."

    "text": "The Fraud Summit, put on annually by the Jindal School’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, gathers professionals interested in the latest trends in fraud schemes and fraud prevention. The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. Today, there are countless scams designed to separate people from their money that calls for a higher degree of diligence and skepticism than ever before, said former top-flight FBI agent, Eric O’Neill. O’Neill, who helped capture the most notorious spy in U.S. history and the real-life hero behind the movie Breach, addressed nearly 400 professionals in the internal auditing field recently at the 2009 UT Dallas Fraud Summit. As a partner with the Georgetown Group, a fraud investigative and consulting firm, O’Neill now draws on the same investigative acumen he used as an FBI counterintelligence operative to assist clients in the private sector. “What happened to an honest wage for an honest day’s work?” O’Neill said. “If there’s a way to cheat you out of your money, someone’s going to do it, and that’s why as a society, we’ve become people with our guards way up.” O’Neill told the group that when the economy weakens, fraudulent activity strengthens, and fraudsters exploit people who are more vulnerable and desperate for help and cash. “Think of the old axiom: Desperate times call for desperate measures. We’re certainly in desperate times, fraud is on the rise, and I don’t see it stopping any time soon,” O’Neill said. O’Neill said technological advances have made fraud “easier, more pervasive and more persuasive.” The power of the Internet and information technology has helped cybercriminals recycle and perfect older ploys, such as bogus work-at-home schemes, while designing thousands of new ones. “It’s just as easy now for someone in Dallas, Texas, to defraud you as it is for someone sitting in Belarus or anywhere around the world, because all they need is a computer and Internet access,” he said. On the corporate side, economic espionage poses the greatest threat as fraudsters attempt to steal companies’ greatest asset – their intellectual property. Fraudsters comb web sites and marketing material, review filings with regulatory agencies and scan trade floor conferences looking for any information that grants them access to a company’s intellectual property. “Occasionally a vendor will put out information that they might not have wanted to release. You’d be amazed how many clients will put things on the web site because they want to look really special and unique, and they forget that they’ve just given their (intellectual property) to the world,” O’Neill said. “We’ve all sort of become like business and financial 4-year-olds,” O’Neill said. “Don’t speak to strangers. … Don’t take candy from Bernie Madoff. Don’t accept a car ride from Robert Hanssen. Turn and run away from telemarketers,” O’Neill told the audience. “We are in the age of diligence … You must know who you’re dealing with and discover a way to trust them. This isn’t really about fraud. It’s about trust, so be a little bit paranoid. A little bit of paranoia can be a great asset,” O’Neill said. The Fraud Summit is held annually and is sponsored by UT Dallas School of Management’s Center for Internal Auditing."

The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. Held annually by the School of Management’s Center for Internal Auditing, the UT Dallas Fraud Summit has become one of the nation’s top fraud conferences for professionals in the internal auditing field. This year’s conference raised $75,000 for the school’s internal auditing program, $22,000 of which will be dedicated to internal audit scholarships. For more information about the UT Dallas Internal Audit Program, visit: The latter turned out to be the case, as Beam told about 400 internal auditing professionals earlier this month at UT Dallas’ fifth annual Fraud Summit. The former healthcare executive shared the inside story of the massive accounting fraud that crippled outpatient healthcare giant HealthSouth. The conference, co-sponsored by the School of Management’s Center for Internal Auditing, featured a cross-section of government and law enforcement representatives who gathered to discuss the latest in fraud trends, schemes and prevention techniques. Beam, himself a convicted felon, learned his lesson the hard way after working for Richard Scrushy, the former HealthSouth CEO accused of ordering his employees to “cook the books.” Beam had barely started his first day of work when Scrushy asked him to sit in on a contract presentation to Scrushy’s boss. During the meeting, Scrushy told his boss, “Aaron and I worked on this contract last night for hours,” Beam said. “I didn’t know what to think. I hadn’t been to work for 30 minutes and I’d already been included in a lie,” Beam recalled. “Today, looking back, I realize that at that very moment, Richard Scrushy was probably testing me to see what kind of player I was and how I’d react to being included in a lie.” Drawing on his recently published book, HealthSouth: The Wagon to Disaster, Beam recounted lessons learned. The book looks at the meteoric rise and colossal collapse of HealthSouth – from a two-room office, to a global corporation with more than 2,200 facilities, to the $2.7 billion accounting fraud that landed Beam in prison. The fraud, he said, took everything he had, including his 25-acre “Beam Acres” estate outside Mobile, Ala., with a million-dollar home, tennis and basketball courts, regulation-size football field and a music stage. He has gone from a CFO earning $500,000 a year to running his own one-man, lawn-care business in Alabama “I didn’t know what to think. I hadn’t been to work for 30 minutes and I’d already been included in a lie,” Beam recalled. Aaron Beam, former CFO After working together at Lifemark Corp. in Houston, Beam joined Scrushy in forming HealthSouth, built on a new concept dreamed up by Scrushy. It expanded quickly, and Scrushy’s charisma and salesmanship propelled its growth and stock price. “He was very much the darling of Wall Street,” Beam said. “It was quite impressive to see Richard Scrushy perform. I remember many times we would go present at investor conferences. Richard would make his presentation, and I’d watch the investors leave, make calls in the lobby, and the stock would go up 1, 2 and 3 points. It was like if you knew when Richard Scrushy was speaking, you had insider information.” Scrushy, Beam said, became “an ego on steroids,” adding that the CEO quit wearing a watch because “it was always whatever time Richard wanted it to be.” As HealthSouth’s revenues grew to more than $3.5 billion, Beam enjoyed luxury items that were the signature of his success: a beach house, condo in the French Quarter, private planes, fancy cars, even Hermes ties worth $30,000. “I was a rock star,” Beam told the audience. “I could go into any restaurant and see people pointing out that they wanted to talk to me, meet me and tell me what a great job I was doing. It was pretty heavy stuff.” In 1996, things took an ugly turn when Scrushy realized the company would not meet Wall Street’s expectations and then demanded fraud to make up the difference, Beam said. But after misrepresenting the numbers for four quarters, Beam said he felt anguished and guilt-ridden. “I just didn’t have the courage or the ethical bearing to stand up to Richard. I didn’t say ‘No, this is wrong,’” Beam said. “My life changed. I couldn’t sleep. I had crossed the line and had done something I couldn’t deal with, and it was just terrible.” “I was a rock star,” Beam told the audience. “I could go into any restaurant and see people pointing out that they wanted to talk to me, meet me and tell me what a great job I was doing. It was pretty heavy stuff.” Aaron Beam Ashamed of his part of HealthSouth’s fraud, Beam retired in 1997 and moved to Beam Acres, where he lived until the company’s fraud was revealed in 2003. Beam pleaded guilty to bank fraud and served three months at Maxwell Air Force Base. After the HealthSouth fraud news broke, the prosecuting attorney said that 17 people came forward and admitted their involvement, said Beam. “One person denied knowing about it: Richard Scrushy,” he said. Beam said Scrushy spent more than $20 million on lawyers and also bought a TV station where he broadcasted himself preaching at an inner-city church. Despite the testimony of Beam and other HealthSouth executives, Scrushy was acquitted, but in 2006, he was convicted in a separate case of bribing an Alabama governor and is now serving a seven-year prison term. Among Beam’s words of wisdom: “If you’re asked to commit fraud, just say ‘no.’ It shouldn’t be a hard decision. … You have to set a high standard of ethical behavior or you will get into a mess like I did,” Beam said. “Today I’m a felon, and that’s what I’ll be for eternity,” Beam said. “Before the fraud broke, people would ask me what I did before I retired and I’d say I was founder and former CFO of HealthSouth. But today when people ask me what I did before I retired I kind of look away and say I was an accountant and hope they don’t ask me any other questions.” Media Contact: The Office of Media Relations, UT Dallas, (972) 883-2155, newscenter@utdallas.edu."

The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. Whether it’s an elaborate work-from-home offer, a monetary prize promised if you “act now” and send an advance fee to win, or countless other “opportunities,” anti-fraud experts have three words for you: Don’t do it. Identity theft, investment scams, lottery schemes, mortgage fraud and hundreds of “can’t miss” offers are on the rise across the nation, demanding a higher degree of diligence and skepticism, experts told more than 400 investigators and auditors at the UT Dallas School of Management’s 6th annual Fraud Summit held March 24-25. The sold-out Fraud Summit, sponsored by the school’s Center for Internal Excellence, has grown in reputation and is now one of the most well-recognized internal audit-related fraud conferences worldwide. Experts discussed such topics as the latest trends in white-collar crime, emerging fraud techniques, lessons from corporate criminals and “Why People Turn to the Dark Side.” Swindlers bilked consumers out of an estimated $1.7 billion in 2010, U.S. Postal Inspector Tyrone Cox told the audience, citing statistics from the Federal Trade Commission, which also reports that most consumer complaints filed last year were fraud-related. Although fraud crimes don’t involve violence, Cox said, they are just as serious because they prey on society’s most vulnerable – the economically disadvantaged, the unemployed and the elderly – who believe that an investment opportunity that arrives out of the blue could bring them fortunes. “Don’t think you can’t be victimized,” Cox said. “People buy expensive cars, boats, watches – all off of other people’s money. They are wicked people.” How do you spot a scammer? Cox says to look for: unrealistic returns, pressure to reinvest, no investment reports or a pitch from a person with an extremely flashy lifestyle. What can you do to protect yourself? Before making any commitment, Cox said, investigate credentials by contacting the Better Business Bureau, banks, investment reports and conducting site visits. The same methods of deceit and violation of trust designed to defraud consumers are also at the heart of corporate fraud. Former New York Times investigative reporter Kurt Eichenwald said when he was asked to cover corporate fraud, he didn’t believe the assignment would become a turning point for his career. “I thought, ‘How much corporate fraud could there be?’ But 20 years later I’m still investigating corporate fraud because there’s a never-ending supply of it,” Eichenwald told the audience. “What’s so odd about it is that almost without fail, every single fraud case grows out of the same dirt.” Eichenwald, best-selling author of The Informant, which was later made into a movie starring Matt Damon, has spent his career uncovering fraud and deciphering the staggering impact of corporate scandals on world markets, employees, customers, shareholders and public confidence. Audience members received a copy of Eichenwald’s most recent book, Conspiracy of Fools, which exposes the corporate deceit and betrayal in the Enron scandal. The collapse of Enron was the “greatest corporate fraud of all time,” but it was incompetence and mismanagement at the top, rather than greed, that ultimately destroyed the company, Eichenwald said. As a result of its deceptive accounting practices, including the creation of earnings, the manufacture of cash flow and the concealment of debt, Enron executives misled its board, investors and the public about its financial condition. In 1996, things took an ugly turn when Scrushy realized the company would not meet Wall Street’s expectations and then demanded fraud to make up the difference, Beam said. But after misrepresenting the numbers for four quarters, Beam said he felt anguished and guilt-ridden. Enron is a lesson in arrogance, recklessness and greed, Eichenwald said, and major corporations caught in accounting scandals following Enron have corporate cultures mimicking Enron’s: weak controls, unrealistic returns, closed-door policies and an arrogant management style. “Columbia, HCA, WorldCom, HealthSouth and Enron – every one of them had a belief that they were geniuses, and it’s that arrogance that feeds into sloppiness,” he said.

Many successful people have a knack for “reading people.” Quickly understanding how a potential client, boss or top executive will react can be a valuable asset. Those skills, or “rapid-fire profiling,” will be the subject of training and a keynote speech by author, documentary producer and independent investigative journalist Dan Korem at the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s seventh annual Fraud Summit on March 29-30. Korem defines rapid-fire profiling as the ability to obtain crucial behavioral data about a person on the spot, without tests or batteries of questions. In a daylong interactive session, he will teach participants how to profile almost anyone without stereotyping. Using interactive keypads, participants will profile video clips of real people in real situations. Within a day, the average attendee improves from 25 percent to 75 percent accuracy, Korem said. Korem, president of Korem & Associates, said he and his faculty have trained more than 35,000 professionals worldwide. He developed the Korem Profiling System after several years of research and introduced it in his 1997 book The Art of Profiling – Reading People Right the First Time. Each of the Fraud Summit’s 425 attendees will receive a copy of the expanded second edition of the book. Korem said the system applies to recruiting, sales, negotiations, team leadership, coaching and recruiting athletes, investigations, military operations and educating students. The sold-out conference, hosted by JSOM’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, has grown in reputation and attendance since it began in 2006. Featuring a day of workshops and a daylong summit, the event is recognized as a pre-eminent internal audit-related fraud conference. This year, the summit will net $110,000, which will go toward student scholarships and an endowment fund benefiting the internal audit profession. “We’ve built the summit into an event that has achieved brand recognition and a reputation that makes people want to return year after year,” said Mark Salamasick, the center’s director and head of JSOM’s internal audit program. “It’s a quality, first-class event featuring speakers who are unique, charismatic and typically difficult to book. It also offers great networking opportunities.” How can rapid-fire profiling assist auditors in their daily tasks? “Auditors are the windows into how companies function,” Mr. Korem said. “They are the ones who monitor systems and ensure they function properly. Auditors regularly use rapid-profiling skills for fact gathering — increasing time efficiencies, as well as the quality and accuracy of data.” Other presenters include UT Dallas senior accounting and finance lecturer Richard Bowen and Frederick Bennett, managing director in Grant Thornton LLP’s forensic and litigations services practice.

The onslaught of security breaches has companies increasingly relying on a department not typically known for its role in preventing cyberthreats: internal audit. Businesses have a growing need for internal auditors who can size up their data security policies and potential risks, said speakers at the 8th Annual Fraud Summit. The conference, recently hosted by the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s , drew a sold-out crowd of 450 professionals. Keynote speaker Kyle Maxwell BS’04, senior network security analyst for Verizon Business, said most security breaches investigated by his team have involved weak or stolen credentials. Breaches can take months to discover, typically by law enforcement or other third parties, said Maxwell. He added that anti-virus programs are a good precaution but not a guarantee against attacks. “Our detection stinks,” Maxwell said. He added that companies express surprise when breaches are discovered. “They say, ‘We’re compliant,’” Maxwell said. “That’s great, but it’s not working. I don’t have all the answers, but we need to find them.” The Jindal School is working to add courses to fill the growing need for auditors skilled in evaluating hacking and malware threats. “You’re going to see some students coming out of UTD in the future who have a concentration in cybersecurity,” said Mark Salamasick, director of the Center for Internal Auditing and senior lecturer in accounting, who organized the fraud summit. A portion of the proceeds from the summit will be used for scholarships for students preparing for internal audit careers. The conference raised about $35,000 for scholarships and $50,000 for an internal audit endowment. In 2011, The Center for Internal Auditing Excellence set a goal to raise $1 million for an endowment to support scholarships, teaching assistance, seminars, conferences, research and educational programs. UT Dallas’ internal audit program is one of five recognized by the Institute of Internal Auditors as a Center for Internal Auditing Excellence. Dr. Hasan Pirkul, dean of the Naveen Jindal School of Management and Caruth Chair of Management, announced at the Fraud Summit that JSOM will provide a $50,000 matching contribution for the endowment. That brings the total raised so far for the endowment to $600,000. The conference featured speakers from leading accounting and fraud investigation firms and UT Dallas faculty. Attendees each received a copy of A Guide to Forensic Accounting Investigation, co-edited by Steven Skalak, partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers who gave an address on “Doing Business in the Big East: Emerging Assurance Issues in China.” Dr. Rebecca Files, assistant professor of accounting, led a session titled, “The Benefits of Cooperating with Regulators: Evidence from Academic Research,” for firms trying to determine policy on whether to cooperate with regulators. The summit explored the many ways that auditors can use technology to detect fraud, including sessions on “How to Detect and Prevent Fraud Using Data Analysis” and “Cybercrime Inferno.” Maxwell, the alumnus who now works for Verizon, described fraud cases that were both galling and entertaining. There was the computer programmer who outsourced his job to a programmer in China while he played video games and surfed the Web at work. Then there were the fraudsters who pulled off a multi-million ATM heist without going near an actual machine by taking advantage of a software misconfiguration. The culprits were caught, providing successful conclusions – and plenty of lessons for auditors.

A felon who played a big role in the infamous Crazy Eddie scheme in the 1970s and 1980s said it’s not about what you can do to crack down on fraud. It’s all about what not to do. Sam Antar, the former chief financial officer of the New York-based appliance retailer with “insaaaaane” prices, described how to understand the mind of a fraudster during the ninth annual Fraud Conference recently hosted by the Naveen Jindal School of Management. The conference, which also featured sessions on cybersecurity and cyberwarfare, drew a sold-out crowd of nearly 700 professionals, the biggest audience the event has ever drawn. Antar said fraud is about diversion, “making someone look this way while you’re doing something over here.” The Fraud Conference, held annually by the Naveen Jindal School of Management, is one of the most recognized fraud summits for professionals in the internal auditing field. It brings together auditing professionals, students, government and law enforcement representatives. To learn more about the internal auditing program at UT Dallas, visit: To understand the mind of a criminal, you have to understand human relationships. Criminals prey on the trusting nature of people and take advantage of personal relationships “because only then can we take advantage of our victim,” Antar said. “It’s easier to steal from somebody, deceive somebody, when they like you.” During his keynote address, Antar showed a clip from the movie Wall Street and quoted the character of Gordon Gekko to explain why white-collar criminals commit their crimes: “It’s not about the money. It’s the game.” “The only reason I’m here now is because I got caught,” he said. Crazy Eddie skimmed profits, evaded taxes, laundered money, fudged inventories and was even featured on Saturday Night Live before the business collapsed in 1987. “It was a 20-year crime, and we took advantage of every opportunity along the way,” Antar said. To avoid prison, Antar testified against his relatives who ran the business with him and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice. “It’s easier to steal from somebody, deceive somebody, when they like you.” Sam Antar, former chief financial officer of appliance retailer Crazy Eddie He now uses his criminal expertise to expose accounting problems at other companies and advise the FBI, the Justice Department, the IRS, accounting students and business groups about how to root out savvy fraudsters. While part of the Crazy Eddie scam, Antar said he never obstructed auditors from doing their work. But he used multiple techniques to distract them, such as hiring young, inexperienced auditors and diverting them with attractive women while they worked. After Antar spoke, attorneys from the eastern and northern Texas branches of the U.S. Attorney’s Office asked him how companies can prevent fraud, what motivated him to become a government witness, why he believes ethics classes don’t work and why he comes across as having little remorse for his crimes. “Remorse is just a matter of words. But I’m getting up and standing in front of 700 people and admitting my sins … can you do that?” Antar said. “Redemption is action. You’re not going to learn if you don’t hear from people like me.” Media Contact: The Office of Media Relations, UT Dallas, (972) 883-2155, newscenter@utdallas.edu."

Most fraudsters don’t see themselves as wrongdoers and are typically surprised they get caught, UT Dallas alumnus James Ratley BS’85 told the audience at the 10th annual Fraud Summit hosted by the Naveen Jindal School of Management in March. “You cannot steer them into confessing,” he said. “You have to convince them it’s in their best interest.”. The conference, which attracted its largest audience ever with about 700 participants and a lineup of 35 speakers, featured tips on uncovering corruption, sessions on cybersecurity and insights into a fraudster’s mind, and the unveiling of a new Jindal School scholarship. The scholarship, named in honor of Ratley, a three-time keynote speaker at the event, was announced along with its first recipient, accounting graduate student Sarah Carraher, by UT Dallas President David E. Daniel. Proceeds from the conference benefit the Jindal School’s Internal Auditing Excellence program, whose students helped ensure that the event ran smoothly. The program is one of only three in the U.S. to receive the prestigious Center for Internal Auditing Excellence designation. Ratley, president and CEO of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and a former police officer, said that people committing fraud are typically very engaging and likeable. “They want to bond with you,” he said. “That’s because they have no credibility. They want to use your credibility.” Ratley said it is imperative for employers and organizations to make it tough to steal from them. “We owe our young employees internal controls,” he said. “Too much trust is very unfair to the person trusted. There are no small frauds. Only frauds that haven’t had time to reach maturity.” The conference also featured Stephen Minder, the chief audit executive at Archer Daniels Midland during its international price-fixing scandal in the 1990s, a story that was the basis for the movie The Informant starring Matt Damon. Minder said fraud is most likely when there are seven signs of ethical collapse in the organization. They are: “Every chief audit executive needs to be ready every day to resign their job,” said Minder, who founded YCN Group in 2007 after retiring from Archer Daniels Midland. He said auditors need to have access to all files — whether on paper or on a computer — whenever they like. He said it is imperative that the board and its audit committee be willing to discuss fraud, errors and illegal acts uncovered by internal audits. And the audit team must be equipped to do its work. “We live in the world of big data,” Minder said. “We have to have the right tools.” This story was reported and written by freelance contributor Jeanne Spreier.

    "text": "The Fraud Summit, put on annually by the Jindal School’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, gathers professionals interested in the latest trends in fraud schemes and fraud prevention. In 2016, the summit featured two keynote speakers, mortgage meltdown whistleblower Richard Bowen, now a Jindal School accounting faculty member, and CPA, certified internal auditor and certified fraud examiner Joanne Fox Phillips, the director of internal audit for a midstream oil and gas company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and author of Revenge of the Cube Dweller (Austin Texas: River Grove Books, 2014), a novel about corporate fraud. The two-day summit also offered continuing education in 24 breakout sessions that covered topics ranging from construction fraud to mobile device security. “What would you do if you saw illegal behavior in your office … [if] you knew there were clear violations of your corporation’s guiding principles?” This is the question Citigroup whistleblower Richard Bowen, now a UT Dallas faculty member, put to the audience in his keynote address to the Fraud Summit held on campus March 31 and April 1. To a sold-out audience made up largely of accountants, auditors and risk managers, Bowen, a senior lecturer in accounting at the Naveen Jindal School of Management, recounted the misgivings he felt and actions he took after he discovered, early in 2006, that his Citigroup division, where he was senior vice president and business chief underwriter, had been out of compliance since at least 2005. He discovered that mortgages the company prospectus said were in compliance, in fact, were not. “We were misleading investors,” Bowen said. He sent an email to Citigroup’s board of directors and its top executives. Despite the emails, closed-door testimony in Washington, D.C., and evidence provided to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Bowen said he found little interest among those above him to investigate his allegations of wrongdoing. The commission, formed by Congress after the 2008 economic meltdown, did make referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice recommending a top Citigroup executive be looked at for violations of the law. But, Bowen told summit attendees, no action was taken. His testimony, recently released by the federal government has not been followed up on, to the best of his knowledge. He recounted FCIC directions to edit his written submission to eliminate his most damning allegations and discoveries or he would be denied an opportunity to testify. Then, mysteriously, he wasn’t listed in online archives as an FCIC witness, nor were his submissions cataloged, he said. And despite the FCIC recommending a criminal investigation of Citigroup executive Robert Rubin, there is no evidence that the U.S. Department of Justice ever took action. “If you don’t truly expect people to act ethically, you won’t get ethical behavior,” Bowen said. “When people see others who they think are similar to them cheat, they are more likely to cheat.” No one wanted to hear the warnings, and no one took action, Bowen said, adding that the entire scope of the financial crisis cost the U.S. economy $20 trillion. “If you don’t truly expect people to act ethically, you won’t get ethical behavior,” Bowen said. “When people see others who they think are similar to them cheat, they are more likely to cheat.” The saga continues as Bowen, along with former SEC investigator Gary Aguirre, former bank regulator William Black and former Countrywide Financial executive Michael Winston have formed Bank Whistleblowers United. Since their whistleblowing days, the four say, they are unemployable in their chosen professions. Bowen told the audience that in retrospect, he should have taken his concerns outside Citigroup faster. But, he warned, “if you don’t truly have commitment from the top, you are going to be frustrated.” Breakout session speakers at the 2016 Fraud Summit included: Courtenay Thompson, who spoke about construction fraud, said if auditors kept their eyes on a handful of “tools,” construction fraud would be detected more often. These include: Thompson said relatively low-tech tools — such as video cameras at the job site or GPS tracking devices on trucks — have been shown to be particularly effective. In another breakout, Vanessa Salinas Beckstrom and Shanna St. Martin, with PwC, discussed fraud and the challenges of doing business in Latin America. Of 167 nations on the Corruption Perception Index of 2015, seven Latin American nations have scores greater than 100 (indicating more corruption). Venezuela and Haiti are tied at 158. Mexico is at 95; the U.S. is at 16. Chile, Beckstrom noted, historically has been stable and has a relatively low CPI of 23. This is important to U.S. companies as they adhere to the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for companies and their supervisors to influence or bribe anyone with any personal payments or rewards. Beckstrom and St. Martin said it can be a challenge to ferret out corruption in overseas operations, but there are ways to do it. “Spend your resources where fraud is most likely,” St. Martin said, noting that 85 percent of FCPA cases involve third-party payments. She said a lot of the issues boiled down to strong corporate governance. Both advised companies doing business in Latin America to ensure their policies and procedures were clear, that they were in locally understandable terms and that data analysis was being done when possible. “You need to understand the corruption risks,” Beckstrom said.

    "text": "The Fraud Summit, put on annually by the Jindal School’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, gathers professionals interested in the latest trends in fraud schemes and fraud prevention. The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. A record-breaking 900 people are registered to attend the 12th annual Fraud Summit at UT Dallas taking place at the end of the month. Presented by the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, the March 30 and 31 summit is one of the top fraud conferences in the United States for professionals in the field of internal auditing. The conference, sponsored by the Dallas Chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors, benefits the Jindal School’s Internal Auditing Excellence program. Program students help ensure that the event runs smoothly, and this year about 60 have volunteered. “This event benefits our scholarship endowment fund,” said Joseph Mauriello, program and center director. “This year our endowment will hit $1 million, and we’ll be able to award 60 to 80 scholarships.” Summit keynote speakers are Toby Groves, a former fraudster turned cognitive scientist, and Dr. Mark Nigrini, an assistant professor at West Virginia University’s College of Business and Economics and an authority on forensic analytics. “I’ve heard Toby Groves speak, and he has a fantastic story. He focuses on the psychology of fraud, and he will talk about common signs of fraud and the next steps to take to resolve it,” Mauriello said. “Dr. Nigrini will focus on Benford’s law and other analytic techniques to identify fraudulent documents. “We also have a ‘surprise’ keynote speaker, Angela Witzany. She is the 2016/17 chair of the IIA’s Global Board and head of internal audit for Sparkassen Versicherung AG Vienna Insurance Group, a large life-insurance provider in Austria.” Witzany chose “Audit Never Sleeps” for her theme as IIA global chairman, and it also is the title of her address. Fraud Summit sponsors are BDO, Crowe Horwath, EY, PwC, RSM and Weaver, who each will host summit breakout sessions. The twists and turns that Toby Groves’ life has taken are mind-boggling, and not just to the casual observer. Groves, the owner of one-time successful mortgage brokerage Groves Funding Corp., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to charges that he plotted against and defrauded several financial institutions and falsified his pay on income tax filings. He served two years in federal prison, where he had a lot of time to think about how he got there. “I never thought that anything like what happened to me would happen,” he said in a recent telephone interview. “I never thought anything would go wrong until it did.” A prison sentence was an unlikely scenario in the life of a man who made a solemn promise to his father years before that he would never get into that kind of trouble. Groves grew up on a farm in Ohio and witnessed his father’s heartache when his brother — 20 years older than Toby — was convicted of bank fraud in 1986. “On a Sunday morning my dad opened the newspaper, and there’s my brother’s picture and a headline saying he’d been charged with massive bank fraud. I found my dad doubled over, sobbing. I thought he’d had a heart attack. “My father said to me, ‘Promise me that you will never get in any trouble like this,’ ” Groves said. “And I swore to him that I wouldn’t.” Yet, about 20 years later, Groves appeared before the same judge as his brother, being sentenced to prison for the same crime. When he got out, he set about to learn about the psychology of fraud. “I had thought that I understood fraud, but that was an illusion,” he said. “I was overconfident, and it led me to a bad place. When I faced challenges, I tried to save my reputation — fix a problem before anyone could find out about it. Looking back, it is clear that I was worried about what other people would think of me.” Groves currently is completing his PhD in psychology and speaks to audiences across the U.S. on the topic of the psychology of fraud. His story has been shared on a number of media outlets including National Public Radio and in numerous professional journals, and it is studied by leading researchers and business schools. His book, Lenses, based on his experiences on the speaker’s tour with his late son, who was autistic, is expected to be released next spring. It was his son who challenged him to become a speaker. “He told me that if I really believed everything I’d been saying about the psychology of fraud I would be a hypocrite if I didn’t talk about,” Groves said “I never wanted to be a speaker, but now I love it.” Workplace fraudsters often share certain surprising characteristics, said Dr. Mark Nigrini, whose keynote address and workshop at the UT Dallas Fraud Summit will focus on Forensics Analytics and Employee Fraud. “They are usually among the nicest people in the office, and every time they are found out, people say they never would have suspected them of doing that,” Nigrini said in a recent telephone interview. “In addition, they are usually in a position of trust at a company and, in all of the cases we deal with, about half the time, gambling is involved.” Nigrini, who is best known for his work on using Benford’s law as an auditing and accounting tool to detect anomalies in company data, is the author of Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), which describes tests to detect fraud, errors, estimates, and biases in financial data and of Benford’s law. Benford’s law provides the expected patterns of the digits in the numbers in tabulated data, such as towns and city populations, or fake portfolio returns. Nigrini’s workshop and his keynote address will focus on understanding the fingerprints of fraud numbers. He uses real-life examples and describes the program as entertaining and educational. “In one of the cases that we discuss in the workshop, a man gambled away $6 million at a casino,” he said. “How do you gamble away $6 million and think that it’s a good thing to do? He got caught when his ex-wife made a comment to someone at lunch about how she couldn’t understand how he keeps winning at the casino. He had told her he was winning. Participants in Nigrini’s workshop also discuss ways that fraudulent numbers differ from good numbers. “For example,” he said, “fraudsters enjoy using round numbers. We talk about multiples of 1,000 or 1 million. Fraudsters also usually show excessive growth. If an organization is growing by 4 percent, a fraudster might say it’s growing by 40 percent.” Fraud, he said, is an equal-opportunity employer. “When it comes to committing crimes in general, women tend to be more law-abiding then men,” he said. “But when it comes to fraud, the number [of offenders] is split about 50/50 between men and women.” Nigrini’s forensic work has been referenced in national media, including The Financial Times, The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and he has been featured in numerous radio and TV interviews, including on NBC and the Investigation Discovery Channel.

    "text": "The Fraud Summit, put on annually by the Jindal School’s Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, gathers professionals interested in the latest trends in fraud schemes and fraud prevention. The two-day summit also offers continuing professional education through workshops and a general conference. The workshops offer 8 hours of CPE credit, and the conference offers another 8 hours of CPE credit. Nearly 1,000 people representing more than 100 companies attended the 14th annual UT Dallas Fraud Summit March 28 and 29. Presented and hosted by the Center for Internal Auditing Excellence at the Naveen Jindal School of Management, the summit is one of the leading fraud conferences in the United States for professionals in the field of internal auditing. Keynote speakers for the 2019 summit were: William K. Black , currently a professor at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and the man who accused then-speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Jim Wright and five U.S. senators of doing favors for savings and loan associations in exchange for contributions and other perks. The resulting political uproar and investigation — part of a wider savings and loan crisis at the time — became known as the Keating Five Scandal. Shamoil Shipchandler, a partner at Jones Day law firm, and the former director of the Fort Worth regional office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also served as deputy criminal chief with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas. Nathan Mueller , a reformed fraudster who served more than five years in prison for stealing $8.5 million from his employer. Mueller, an accountant and formerly licensed CPA, speaks at numerous conferences, sharing his story and talking about what goes through the mind of someone who commits fraud. Making sure the culture of corporate compliance is the right fit for a company was the focus of Shipchandler’s program. Typical compliance programs are not customized to individual companies. “It is important to understand how culture affects compliance,” he said, “and how you are going to do compliance. … If you focus on obeying the law, what else are you missing?” Black’s presentation was on rethinking the fraud triangle, a concept created in the 1940s as a means of identifying individuals who might commit workplace fraud. When it was created, experts believed the things that could identify employees who might commit fraud were pressure, such as debt; opportunity, and the ability to rationalize the crime. In the 1940s, women were the most likely to commit fraud, Black said, because they worked in office jobs where opportunity existed. Today, many fraudsters have triple A ratings. Black pointed to the so-called subprime mortgage company crisis of 2007 to 2009 and the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Both involved many companies deemed at the time to be reputable. “If you have a top audit company working for you, people tend to believe you will never commit fraud,” Black said. Sponsored by the Dallas chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors, the summit benefits the Jindal School’s Internal Auditing Excellence program. More than 100 students in the program volunteered to work on the event this year. The Fraud Summit has grown consistently since it started 14 years ago, when there were 100 attendees. Joseph Mauriello, director of the Center of Internal Auditing Excellence, said one of the reasons is its educational value. Attendees receive eight hours of continuing professional education (CPE) credit each for workshops and eight hours CPE for the conference. “We deliver a quality education experience, and folks recognize that,” Mauriello said. “They make this a must-attend event. Also, people love coming to the UT Dallas campus, interacting with students and meeting the next generation of auditors.” Another reason for the summit’s growth, said Chris Linsteadt, assistant director of the center, is the thriving business community in Dallas and the surrounding area. “We’re lucky in Dallas to have so many corporate headquarters located here,” he said. “These companies recognize the value of what we do at UT Dallas.” James Kirkland of State Farm Insurance Company attends the summit every year with one or more of his colleagues. “Our company has an internal audit department, so the summit is a good fit for us,” he said. “I get new information from this event every year.” Mueller, who was the general session keynote speaker, said he was impressed by the event. “It has been a great crowd,” he said. “The audience was very engaged.”"

The Center for Internal Auditing Excellence at the Naveen Jindal School of Management will again host its annual premier event, the Fraud Summit, virtually this year because of the global pandemic. The 16th Annual Fraud Summit, to be held March 25 and 26, will continue with the theme of whistleblowing and feature Elin Kunz, a former compliance officer at Halifax Health Systems who helped put a stop to $86 million in Medicare fraud at the Florida-based company. Twenty years into a career at Halifax Health, Kunz was director of Physician Services when she uncovered questionable physician compensation and unnecessary surgeries. She filed a lawsuit on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act and was later joined in the successful lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition to Kunz, the conference will include a keynote session from Dave Lieber, “The Watchdog” columnist for The Dallas Morning News. A consumer advocate and investigative reporter, Lieber scored first place in the 2019 National Society of Newspaper Columnists Column-Writing Contest. Lieber’s website says: “He fights for Americans and shows them how to save time, money and aggravation. He works to expose corruption and make positive change.” As usual, the Fraud Summit offers continuing professional education credits to attendees, up to 8 hours for workshops in advance of the conference and 8 hours for the conference itself. Other top speakers slated to appear include: The 15th Annual Fraud Summit, held virtually last summer, focused on the plight of whistleblowers in the age of fraud. Keynote speakers included journalist Tom Mueller, author of Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud (New York: Riverhead Books, 2019). Mueller explored “the nature of the whistleblowing act” and profiled insiders who have exposed fraud in America’s public and private institutions. Joseph Mauriello, Center for Internal Auditing Excellence director, has sought to replicate the conference environment in the virtual space. “We wanted our conference attendees to not only benefit from the outstanding content that we offer at our event,” he said, “but to also share in the conference experience of interacting with each other and our sponsoring firms.” To that end, the summit last year incorporated — and will do so again this year — virtual sponsor booths and video capabilities so that sponsors, speakers and attendees can interact. These quick adaptations drew widespread praise from the audience of over 1,000 internal auditors and fraud examiner who attended last summer, Chris Linsteadt, associate director of the Center for Internal Auditing Excellence, said. Linsteadt created the unofficial motto for planning the 2020 and 2021 summits: Adapt and overcome. Academically, the Center for Internal Auditing Excellence oversees the Jindal School’s Internal Auditing Education Partnership, which offers students a strong program in internal audit and risk management through accounting and information management courses. The center puts on the Annual Fraud Summit in conjunction with the Dallas Chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors, and proceeds benefit center students. “The 16th Annual Fraud Summit will be a showcase for understanding the importance of transparency in matters of whistleblowing and fraud as it pertains to good governance,” Mauriello said.

    "text": "It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing of our friend and colleague, Charles “Chuck” Haseman, on Friday, July 12, 2024. Chuck joined UT Dallas in 2021 as a Professor of Practice and was instrumental in launching the Center for Retail Innovation & Strategy Excellence (RISE), serving as its Director. Chuck was passionate about promoting the “STEM side of Retail” through what he called “The Three P’s” – Preparing the Future, Partnering with Thought Leaders and Practice through Research. He inspired students to explore and consider careers within the retail industry, established the first collegiate chapter of the National Retail Federation at UT Dallas and grew its membership to nearly 150 students representing a variety of majors across campus. In January 2023, Chuck was named as one of the Top Retail Experts of 2024 by RETHINK Retail, a platform focused on providing insights, news and analysis about the retail industry. Chuck received this recognition again in 2024, stating, “I am honored and pleased to be selected for the RETHINK Top Retail Experts list because that’s exactly what we strive to do at RISE— rethink the retail sector and transform it for the digital realm.” Chuck had a remarkable balance of passion and intensity but always kept a sense of humor that endeared him to colleagues and students alike. His enthusiasm for the RISE Center’s mission attracted the engagement and support of many Retail Industry leaders. His memorial services will be held on Wednesday, September 11, 2024, at 11:00 a.m.; at the King of Glory Lutheran Church, located at 6411 Lyndon B Johnson Fwy, Dallas, TX 75240. The family has asked that in lieu of flowers, any donations or gifts be made by way of a contribution in his honor to the RISE Center. Please join Ray Hemmig, Chairman of the RISE Center Advisory Council, in honoring Chuck’s impact and legacy with a donation to the RISE Center. To make a gift of any size in memory of Chuck, please visit here and select Center for Retail Innovation & Strategy Excellence. Enter Chuck Haseman in the comments. For additional assistance, please contact Megan Harrison, Director of Corporate Relations, at Megan.Harrison@utdallas.edu. We will continue to keep you updated regarding plans for the RISE Center and future events. As always, we look forward to continuing to work with you in support of RISE."

    "text": "The NRF Association at UTD hosted its second event, the Lunch and Learn session, in which it brought together students, industry professionals, and RISE board members for an afternoon of lunching, learning and networking. The session had two notable speakers: Loc Nguyen, Senior Finance and Strategy at Blank Street, and Jim Skinner, Retired Vice Chairman, COO, and CFO at Neiman Marcus. Both speakers offered unique insights gained from their professional experiences, sharing with attendees a wealth of information about how to navigate the world of business. Joining remotely, Loc Nguyen discussed his time working at David Matthews, the CEO of RevTech Ventures. He provided a behind-the-scenes look at life working for a Series A startup, ranging from accounting to strategic finance. His key takeaway for the students was to be proactive and adaptable as businesses scale. He emphasized taking on new responsibilities, understanding the direction and mission of the business, and understanding pain points so one could effectively fill gaps. Nguyen also emphasized the importance of networking professionally and communicating well. He advised students to over-communicate rather than under-communicate, conduct one-on-one meetings on a regular basis, and give regular progress updates. He further recommended mastering hard skills such as SQL, acquiring new skills, and taking on personal projects to advance one’s career prospects. The latter part of the session was an inspirational speech by Jim Skinner, who has a wealth of experience in leadership positions at EY, Fossil, Neiman Marcus Group, and Hudson Group. Reflecting on his career path, Skinner shared how he initially had no clear direction at EY but soon realized the importance of personal growth. As he progressed to partner, he found himself drawn to retail, believing that the personality of a business played a crucial role in career satisfaction. As he advanced to the position of partner, he discovered that he was increasingly attracted to the retail sector, convinced that the character of a business significantly influenced career satisfaction. Taking a leap of faith, Skinner moved from EY to retail as a CFO via a client relationship. His strategic direction built businesses from scratch to multi-billion-dollar companies. When it came to deciding between 7-Eleven and Neiman Marcus, he opted for the latter, taking on the challenge and global possibilities it presented. He told the story of finding his way through the upheaval of the retail universe, from exploring China as a potential market to coping with COVID-19’s unpredictability. Skinner concluded by providing lessons on leadership and teamwork, highlighting the fact that victory goes beyond just winning and includes the value of listening and teamwork. The session ended with thought-provoking discussions, allowing students to interact with Skinner, professionals in the field, and RISE board members. Attendees departed the event not just with practical information, but with the understanding that taking risks reaps great rewards. Students got the chance to networking and learn about internship opportunities as well as exciting club events ahead of the semester."

    "text": "The NRF Association at UTD kicked off its first event of the year with “Business of Fashion with UNIQLO,” offering students a closer look at the brand’s sustainability efforts and the intricacies of clothing manufacturing. Michelle Le, Lead University Recruiter, and Nelly Born, Associate Manager of Sustainability, led the session, providing the students with an understanding of UNIQLO’s LifeWear philosophy—creating high-quality, everyday apparel designed to last. Students got hands-on experience with some of UNIQLO’s most popular products, including the premium linen shirt, down jacket, and fluffy yarn fleece while learning about the brand’s tireless sustainability initiatives. Le spoke extensively about how UNIQLO is committed to using sustainable materials and practices: Despite these impressive plans, Le and Born were aware of the challenge of how to express sustainability without greenwashing. To gain some fresh perspectives, they challenged students to brainstorm some ways to showcase sustainability in stores. The winning idea was a storefront window display featuring a mannequin dressed in UNIQLO products on one half, and on the other half, the recycled materials that were used to create the garment—a visually impactful way to show sustainability in action. The session ended with exciting career opportunities for students looking to join UNIQLO that included both short-term and long-term opportunities designed to build leadership skills and gain global business perspective. With a mix of industry insights, creative problem-solving, and career opportunities, the event imparted students with resounding knowledge about the world of sustainable fashion."

Examples of such target groups include digital asset management, roboadvising, AI for trading, blockchain-enabled financing (ICO/STO), SPAC development and token economics. These are Executive Education programs in Fintech that will target a particular entity – such as a bank or an insurance company – and offer customized content in response to the specific needs of the entity. Examples of such programs include managing digital assets, tokenization of digital assets, analytics of digital assets, and operational excellence. Certificate programs consist of programs that deal with specific problem areas of contemporary relevance such as applied machine learning in finance, NLP for finance, roboadvising, Fintech project management, token design, decentralized app development, etc. The Center for the Management of Financial and Digital Asset Technologies engages in active outreach within the DFW community and corporate industry partners. We target several areas of cooperation and outreach. First, the center engages with the DFW area’s Fintech and Digital Asset Management companies as well as startups to establish areas of mutual interest. The partnerships allow faculty members to access funding and data, and to conduct use-inspired and practically important research projects. Second, the center will have an advisory board, to formalize and enhance the engagement with the corporate partners. The advisory board members will provide valuable insights on the target markets, provide networking opportunities for faculty and students, and serve as the advocates for the center and JSOM in general. Third, the center will host an event that brings together top industry experts to discuss various topics related to Fintech and Digital Asset Management, for example, Fintech and the future of work, Digital Asset Management, FD-Tech education, FD-Tech talent, FD-Tech policy and regulation."

    "title": "About Morris Hite",
    "text": "Morris Hite was born in Oklahoma in 1910. His grandparents taught him to work hard and value both formal and informal education. Even as a youth, Hite was a motivated and talented salesman, selling his family’s milk and home-grown fruit door to door. He left home at 15 to work as a cartoonist in a work-study program sponsored by Eugene Arnett. During this period, he studied issues of Printer’s Ink magazine and decided he wanted a career in advertising. In 1927, he landed his first job in advertising and promotions: He became a movie promoter with Griffith Amusement. He sold tickets, passed out handbills, collected merchandise to be given away and even arranged a publicity stunt or two. From this beginning, he worked for several other advertising agencies until starting his own agency at age 19. Hite moved to Dallas and joined the Tracy-Locke-Dawson agency in 1937. He brought in new clients and helped existing clients grow their businesses. By the early 1940s, Hite had earned the No. 2 spot in the Dallas office. In 1942, he left to serve his country. After serving in the U.S. Army in World War II, Hite rejoined Tracy-Locke. Wartime economics had weakened the agency, so his first priority was to reestablish relationships with his former clients. Hite also brought new business to the company and was named Tracy-Locke’s president when Ray Locke retired in 1950. Hite held strong opinions about the best way to serve his clients. He wanted his account executives to understand every aspect of the client’s business. While not common at the time, Hite believed his account executives should conduct research on the client’s business, products, consumer opinions and the effectiveness of the advertising and sales techniques used. He insisted his people develop strong relationships with their clients, including designing a marketing plan for clients that gave them guidance on their strengths and weaknesses as well as ways to increase their business. Hite was at the forefront of new data collection methods in the Southwest. Long before polls, surveys and focus group studies became popular, he believed in seeking consumer opinions directly. He developed a test called “How Much How Good” that his firm used to determine if their advertising was effective. The test asked consumers if they purchased the client’s product, if they had seen the advertising, and if so, what they remembered about the product. Similar techniques are used today. Hite founded M/A/R/C Research to provide research and data analysis services to other advertising agencies. He was among the first to use telephone survey data, and M/A/R/C analysts demonstrated it was comparable to door-to-door survey data. As Tracy-Locke grew, Hite devoted more time to community service. He was invited to join the Dallas Citizens Council. As president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, he worked on two successful bond elections, helping the city raise funds for capital improvements to the convention center and gaining approval for the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He organized a job fair that helped more than 3000 youth find summer jobs. He was instrumental in combining the Dallas and Fort Worth Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas into one. He worked with other leaders in petitioning the state Legislature to establish . He also supported the fledging KERA public television station, personally paying for lunches to help Dallas businessmen learn about the station."

    "text": "His clients included: One of Hite’s favorite clients was the Imperial Sugar Company. Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, was refined from locally grown sugarcane. During World War II, the U.S. government established regulations that gave Imperial Sugar an almost exclusive right to distribute sugar in Texas. Following the war, Hite worked with the company to continue its strong market presence. Imperial’s advertising emphasized the purity of sugar. The agency created a cookbook that consumers could order by sending in the “Pure Cane Sugar” tag found on each bag. They advertised heavily in print and on the radio, sponsoring a popular radio program that featured The Stamps-Baxter Quartet. Hite learned the Borden Milk business from the ground up. He arose at dawn to ride on a milk delivery route, even learning to load the truck. He asked shoppers why they purchased Borden Milk and then used their answers to develop Borden’s advertising campaign. In one of the more memorable campaigns, Hite promoted Borden buttermilk as a post-holiday hangover cure. The ads, which ran in December and early January, featured the slogan “Bounce Back with Buttermilk” and included a hangover sympathy card to be sent to friends along with a jug of Borden buttermilk. Hite effectively used television and celebrity endorsements for Haggar slacks. One memorable television spot showed Haggar’s Forever-Prest slacks being crumpled and wadded up and then crushed by a steam roller. The pants were then held up and shown to be wrinkle-free. The ad was so effective that within 24 hours after its first run, Gimbels department store sold its entire Haggar slacks inventory and demanded a rush shipment. Hite also arranged celebrity endorsements from Mickey Mantle and Roger Staubach. Mrs. Baird’s Bread was a long-standing client. Ninnie Baird began selling her bread to support her family after her husband’s death in 1912. Hite effectively used the Baird family’s story to market the bread. Some of his more famous slogans were “Stays fresh longer” and “From the Baird family to you.” Mrs. Baird’s Bread still emphasizes the bread’s freshness and the company’s family heritage as they celebrate 100 years in business. Maryland Club Coffee, an upscale product of the Duncan Coffee Company, benefited from Hite’s creative approach. Although the product cost more per pound than any of its competitors, Hite convinced consumers it actually cost less than other brands since its richness meant less coffee was needed to make each cup. Hite’s slogan, “The coffee you’d drink if you owned all the coffee in the world,” was featured in ads showing Dallas socialites drinking Maryland Club Coffee."

    "text": "On behalf of the faculty, staff and students of the UT Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management, I want to extend our warmest welcome to all participants coming to our school to attend the 2018 Online MBA (OMBA) Conference. This is the second annual OMBA conference. A simple discussion around a conference table three years ago led to its creation, and it now serves as a national gathering for dialogues about improving online MBA programs. The 2018 OMBA Conference, I feel sure, will spawn program improvement ideas, spark research activity and provide excellent networking opportunities for collaboration-building between colleagues. The scope of this event, Online MBA – Keeping Pace with the Future, invites program decision- makers to bring and test new ideas, and prepare to move them forward in the changing PMBA landscape. I hope that over these three days, some successful collaborations are born. I would like to thank the distinguished invited speakers for attending and for their contributions to the conference. I also thank the advisory board members for their efforts in ensuring a rigorous review process to select high quality presentations. Dr. Hasan Pirkul, Dean and Caruth Chair of Management"

Learn about the visual and structural building blocks that create clear, user-friendly and SEO-optimized web pages. Well-organized written content is the fundamental element of good web design. When content owners provide JSOM Web Services with quality content that is written to inspire visitors and drive them to action, the design process flows naturally from the content provided. Learn how to use headings, blocks, colgrids, accordions and tables to organize a web page so nicely that your visitors will want to come back. Learn about the visual and structural building blocks of creating a page that is clear, user-friendly and SEO-optimized. While video, images and graphics are effective supporting elements, text is the heart and soul of a web page. And JSOM Web Services has researched and tested the most effective ways to present the words on your pages. Text should be concise and not duplicated, as pages without distinct information can hinder search engine rankings. Learn more about how and why we work with headings, paragraphs, readability, styling text, lists, dates and times to ensure that your page is a pleasure to read. Each web page is an essential piece of a greater whole. Effectively linking pages together creates a journey for visitors so they can discover who we are and what they want to know about us. Hyperlinks support the message of a page, offer examples or documentation, provide options to learn more information and drive visitors to take important actions. The tools and rules are pretty simple. Get the details about how and when to use text hyperlinks, buttons and image links to help visitors get everything they need while on our website. Imagery is the spoonful of sugar that helps visitors digest all of the written content on a page. Photos of people doing meaningful things can draw visitors into the spirit of a web page, and graphics can make content more skimmable so visitors can quickly find what is relevant to them. Images on a web page always serve the page’s purpose emotionally or conceptually. Read the introduction to images and then dig into the specifics of portrait images, hero images, images and text together on a page, images with colgrid, images in posts, infographics and stat boxes and charts. Posts allow people – students, alumni, faculty and staff – to speak directly to our visitors in their own voices. While we do our best to inform and inspire visitors on our web pages, sometimes it’s best to get out of the way and let people speak for themselves about their JSOM experiences. People who are excited to share their successes and personal growth as a result of their time in the JSOM community can be the most persuasive aspect of a web page’s message. When someone has a proud testimonial or exciting student experience, these can become posts, and we can use posts throughout the website in dynamic ways. The topic of posts is extensive and deep – as it suits our broad and diverse JSOM community – and this section of our web standards has a lot of information about Student Testimonials, Alumni Spotlights, Student Ambassadors, Student Experiences, Resource Articles and Podcasts."

    "title": "Create and Embed Posts",
    "text": "This page explores how to use posts in the JSOM web template. The new JSOM web template allows for creating both pages and posts. The post types above that can be displayed both as unique web pages and as dynamic content used throughout the site. Two other post types are FAQs and Embedded Content Blocks, which are not unique pages but rather function only as a modular piece of a larger page. This page details how to create a post that can be available for dynamic use across the website, and you will find examples of the different templates available for this purpose. Posts are similar to pages, but they have additional requirements in order to function successfully both as an individual page and as a piece of dynamic, embedded content. The title is displayed both on the post page and when used dynamically. The content is displayed only on the post page. In WordPress, below the content panel for each post is a block called “SEO.” Open that block to see the Title Tag, Meta Description and Meta Robots. Leave this field blank for posts. The meta title automatically take the value from the WordPress post title field. Leave this field blank for posts. The meta description automatically uses the opening text of the post. The SEO plugin box below the WordPress content field has options for Meta Robots. Most posts keep the default of “Index” and “Follow,” but FAQs and Embedded Content Blocks posts are not intended to be viewed as pages but only as embedded content. FAQs and Embedded Content Blocks posts should be “No-index” and “Follow,” because we don’t want them to appear in search results. This content appears in the embedded, dynamic use of the post. Each post type has a template for how the excerpt needs to be written with HTML. Carefully follow the excerpt requirements in the Developer Documentation for each post type. When posts are used dynamically we usually set the sort order to reverse chronological order, but you can use custom fields to create a custom sort order. Each post in a category, such as “general-mba-faq,” would need a numerical value in a custom field called “sort_key.” Then, when embedding the content, the embed shortcode needs the additional parameters: meta_key=’sort_key’ orderby=’meta_value_num’. Posts in that category will appear in the numerical order of each post’s “sort_key” value. There is usually a parent category, such as “faq” and a child category, such as “general-mba-faq.” For each post, select just the child category. The post will inherit the parent category. The Featured Image appears in the embedded, dynamic content. It is usually the same as the image at the top of the post content, but you must select it in the Featured Image panel, below the “Categories” field in WordPress. For some posts, the Featured Image might be different from the post images, including some Alumni Spotlights, where the post image is casual and the Featured Image is more formal. For web accessibility compliance, any image used as a Featured Image needs to have an alt value assigned to it in WordPress. Go to the Media section of the WordPress admin area and click on a photo to see the field options. Enter text that describes the photo in the Alternative Text field, just as you would with an HTML img element. Then tab or click out of the Alternative Text field to commit the text. The word “Saved” will appear at the top of that image information panel. As a rule, a post needs at least one image at the top of the post content and one Featured Image. Usually these are the same image, but you must assign each one. In most cases, a post image should be a square cropped as follows: If a post has one content image and one Featured Image, the content image may be a rectangle that is no more than 630px wide, but the Featured Image should still be a rectangle. When creating a new post, the best way is to: After cloning a post or saving to a new draft, updating the post title automatically updates the permalink. Posts in Page is a plugin that allows posts to be embedded throughout the website using the following parameters: JSOM Web Services has created multiple categories, templates and standards for embedding different types of content on our web pages. The Posts in Page plugin is flexible enough to allow for further customization as the needs arise. View the WordPress editor for this page to see what the shortcode looks like, and note the different parameters. View the WordPress editor for any post to see the details for each template. There are small but important differences in each post type depending on its category, which is why the best way to create a new post is to clone a post from the same category and carefully update every requirement.

    "title": "Format Text",
    "text": "This page explores the major elements we use for formatting text on a page. Headings are the primary way to organize sections of web content semantically and hierarchically. A well-written web page should be easy to divide into sections that support the main topic of the page, which is defined by the page title. Begin each section of a page with an <h2> (such as “Headings,” above), and if that section is also divided, use <h3> (such as “Learn More About Headings,” below), and so on. For more details about how to use headings, read the Headings section of Structuring a Page. There needs to be a paragraph at the top of each web page (below the main heading, “Formatting Text” in this case). The paragraph serves our website visitors by providing context for whatever information follows, and it also serves the broader goals of our website, such as making a strong impression of professionalism and following best SEO practices. You may write more than one paragraph. Paragraphs may be brief, 2-3 sentences even, because the information following the paragraph may not require much introduction, but the paragraph should always be there at the top of the page. A web page should have a minimum of 300-500 words. If you want to create a new page that has fewer than 300 words, consider adding the content to a page that already exists or developing the scope of your new page. Users and search engines want pages that are both concise and thorough, and 300 words minimum is a sweet spot. This web template is wide on desktop, and our research shows that long lines of text are difficult for the user to read. So, for good user experience, try to ensure that lines of text do not stretch the full width of the screen on desktop. Using narrow, smallblock and imagestory are the three primary ways to manage the length of lines of text. Using the class narrow is the preferred way to decrease line-length. It is narrower than smallblock, and it does not add the extra emphasis or division that smallblock does. Also, the amount of characters per line in a narrow element is ideal for ease-of-reading. With smallbock and narrow at your disposal, you can meet most design needs. Another way to decrease the line-length of text is to add a smallblock element inside the wideblock. If the parent wideblock has a background-color, you give the smallblock element the classes white and inner. Because smallblock adds emphasis to the content and is not as narrow on a full-size screen, it is useful but not as versatile as narrow. A third way to manage line length is to wrap the text in an imagestory element and include an image. The line length will adjust based on the widths of both the screen and the image. More text will make it more likely that the lines will extend below the bottom of the image, thereby making the line length take the full width of the container. Note: the imagestory class is not always needed, but images usually need a parent div element. The classes imagestory or fullwidth often work for the parent class. Styling text, when needed, should be done according to the following standards: Lists are a great way to organize content into readable chunks. Below are examples of the types of lists we use and how we nest them when we need to. When nesting lists, the new list needs to be a child (not a sibling) of an <li> element."

    "url": "https://jindal.utdallas.edu/digital-services/web-standards/link-to-content/",
    "title": "Link to Content",
    "text": "This page explores the ways that we link to web pages and files in this template. Hyperlinked text should include the following, wrapped in an <a> tag: Our template underlines hyperlinks unless they are styled like buttons. For all links, hover and focus change the background color for good web accessibility and user experience. Add the class cta-link to an anchor element to create a call-to-action link. A call-to-action link usually ends a section of text. Often the format of a section is image, heading, paragraph, call-to-action. When possible, a piece of content on a page should give the user something to do after they’ve read the content. A call-to-action link serves this purpose. Use the JSOM Heading Standards for capitalization, but do not use punctuation at the end of the text; punctuation doesn’t look good with the arrow at the end of a call-to-action link. Use an action word (verb) as the first word. Below is in example of a call-to-action link. Buttons get the user’s attention, so deploy them with care. Too many buttons on a page can create confusion about what the user is expected to do. A button is a call to action, so it needs clear, descriptive, direct text. Capitalize the important words in a button label. In our template, buttons are simply an html element (usually an <a> tag) with the class “btn.” Adding an additional class gives the button one of the colors seen below. (Note that the buttons don’t float to the right by default; they only float to the right for the purposes of this page.) Buttons are strong as a call-to-action. We use them less often and more specifically than a call-to-action link (above). A button usually links to an application, pdf, or very important web page, such as application process or financial aid information. Also, button labels are better when they’re brief. If the text on an important link is long, consider using the cta-link class instead of btn. For example: The btn-gray button links to additional information. This is the button we use most often. The btn-green button links to registration, application or payment. Usually the button text is a strong verb, such as “Apply,” “Request Information,” or “Register Now.” The btn-orange button is a lesser-used button that links to additional information. As a rule, use btn-orange only as an alternative to btn-gray, when btn-gray would not look good or function well. The btn-inactive button indicates that an action is not currently available, but we want the user to know that either a deadline has passed or the action is coming soon. Be sure to remove the href attribute from an inactive button, so that the link is truly inactive. While text and button links are the most common way to link to content in this web template, there are some cases when it is appropriate to use an image as a hyperlink. It is important that image links be clear to the user, so our image links include either an arrow or a button to reinforce the linking function of the image. Also, it is best to use icons as hyperlinks, not photographs. The purpose of a photograph in our web template is to visually reinforce the message of a page and to add color and emotion to the message, whereas the purpose of an icon is to quickly deliver information to the user. Because icons have this symbolic, informative purpose, icons are better suited than photographs to act as a hyperlink. A sentence will follow with a hyperlink so the catalog can be viewed with one easy click. It will be simply stated and directly take the reader to the catalog. Please review the UT Dallas Graduate Catalog for the most up-to-date curriculum details. Multiple links can be used by being separated and boxed up so clearly stated and a good call-to-action. After a user reads the page content, and there is not one but two or even three actions you would like them to take, multiple links work well individually boxed up. Often, the heading “What would you like to learn about next?” precedes multiple links. Multiple links work well for two, three or four links that are all of equal importance, as shown below:"

    "url": "https://jindal.utdallas.edu/digital-services/web-standards/structure-a-page/",
    "title": "Structure a Page",
    "text": "This page explores the major elements we use for structuring and organizing a page. Headings are the primary way to organize sections of content semantically. Well-written web content uses headings to break up the page into meaningful segments – topics and sub-topics – and create an information hierarchy. Headings comprise h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. The JSOM template automatically creates an h1 using the page title in our content management system (CMS), and there should always be one and only one h1 on any page. h1 is the main topic of the page. h2 elements (for example, “Headings” above) are the sub-topics of h1; h3 elements are the subtopics of h2; etc. Do not skip from h1 to h3, or h2 to h5, for example; headings must be nested logically and sequentially. We frequently use h2 and h3 in page content, sometimes h4, and rarely h5 or h6, but they are available if needed. We use them for organizing the content structure, as in an outline, not for style; use CSS classes, strong, emphasis, or other methods to style text. h1 and h2 are visible above. Below are the remaining heading tags and how they look in this template. Follow the two guidelines below to keep the capitalization of web headings consistent. The Title Capitalization Tool is a good resource for this if you are unsure about how to capitalize a particular title. Just click the “AP” tab, as AP style is the JSOM standard. While headings primarily organize sections of content semantically and hierarchically, blocks organize content visually. Adding a background color class to the element with class wideblock will change the background color of the element, which extends across the entire screen. See the available background color classes below. Note that most wideblock elements also have the class overflow, which ensures that no floating content (such as photos) will extend past the bottom of the container. (Selling blocks do not use the overflow class because the photo extends outside of the first wideblock element by design.) Typically, each h2 element on the page is a good place to start a new wideblock. Smallblock is similar to wideblock, but the left and right edges do not extend to the edges of the screen. Use smallblock to create smaller sections on a page, which can help with structure and visual organization. Smallblock can also add emphasis to a piece of content on a page, such as alerts, warnings, reminders, features, and more. If the smallblock needs to have a white background color, and the parent wideblock has a background color, you give the smallblock element the class white. Also, add the class inner to any smallblock inside a wideblock that has a background color. This ensures that the text inside the smallblock has the correct color. Note that the text color changes depending on the background color of its parent. Typically, each h3 element on the page is a good place to start a new smallblock. warm-gray-0 and no background color class (or white if a parent element has a non-white background color) are the best two colors to alternate wideblock sections on a page. Text is very easy to read on both colors because of the sufficient contrast between the background and text colors. After warm-gray-0 and no background color (or white), this is the next best background color for a normal wideblock on a page. Rarely used, but available. Ideal for selling blocks. Rarely used because this is the footer color. But it is available. Use white for a smaller element that is inside a larger element with a background color. This is the warning class. Use this color for critical information, such as deadlines or cancellations. Rarely used, but available. Orange can add emphasis to a page, but it needs to be far away from the page header, which has the same background color. Rarely used, but good for a call-to-action, statistic boxes or to add emphasis to a page. Used primarily at the top of a page for critical information for important announcements, but not as a warning, which orange-light is reserved for. The selling block is a template piece that is important on top-level pages, such as the main landing page for an academic program. A selling block draws attention, uses a photo, makes a clear and strong value proposition, supports the proposition and uses a call-to-action to drive the user to more information. See the selling block below: Selling blocks have a colfloat element wrapped around the wideblock. They always have an h2, which is sized larger than the normal h2, and they sometimes include a support sentence in a sub-heading element directly below the h2. Selling blocks include a nice, vertical photo on desktop, which changes to a horizontal version of the same photo on mobile. A picture element is required in order to serve different images depending on screen size. The two images are children elements of a picture, and they need to follow the naming convention that states their width and height in pixels in the filename. For the image to be on the right, use the classes right33, right45 or right25, depending on how the design looks. For the image to be on the left, use left33, left45 or left25. Finally, because the image is large and floats, always put a clearfix element after the colfloat. Clearfix makes sure that the next colfloat or wideblock does not touch the photo above it. There are many potential ways to use the Selling Block layout, such as the Contact Block, which is the standard way to present contact information for a page. The blockquote element is optional and is often used for messages from the director of a program.

For important actions such as learning about double degrees, getting admission information or starting an application, Action Blocks are very useful. We often repeat them throughout a website for consistency, and they often appear at the bottom of a page just above the footer.

Vice President, Chief Compliance Officer, NCH Corporation Colgrids divide space into different widths, including 25%, 33%, 45%, 50%, 55% and 67%. Below are the various widths and combinations that the children of a colgrid element can take. As mentioned above, sometimes, an element with a background color class is nested inside an element with a different background color class. In order for the text inside the inner element to have the correct color, you must add the class inner to the child element. See below. Note that the configuration of this row doesn’t work responsively, so don’t use it. This warm-gray-2 element also has the inner class. But, this warm-gray-2 element does not have the inner class. Therefore, the text is styled based on the orange class of the parent wideblock. Tables are a time-tested way to organize web page content, but they can present problems on mobile devices. The more columns a table has, the more likely it is to look bad on a mobile device. Columns may become so narrow that only a few words fit before the line breaks or some content may not even appear on the page. If a table has 2-4 columns, it will likely display well on both desktop and mobile. For tables with five or more columns, you may need to use colgrid or one of the modified table solutions below. But first, let’s start with a simple table. Please read the table requirements in the simple table below: Adding the class “dataTable” to the table element creates a table that is mobile-friendly and optimized for comparing the rows (or columns, on mobile) to one another. A comparison table lets the user scroll horizontally to compare columns, which is how this table solves the problem of successfully displaying its content on mobile devices. *Average Mixing tables with colgrid elements allows for a clean, mobile-friendly layout. Use this format with simple class schedules, for example, with cohort programs. For event schedules, you can use the presentation below, which looks like a table but does not use any table elements. Instead, it uses colgrid. The advantage of this format is that the information stacks nicely on mobile so that the content is useful to attendees before and during the event. The left side of each row shows the time, date, and other logistical details. The right side shows specific information about the session at that time slot, such as the Title, speaker name, speaker bio, and description. 3:00 p.m. – 5:30 p.m. DoubleTree Richardson 1981 North Central Expressway Richardson, TX 75080 5:00 p.m. 5:30 p.m. – 6:30 p.m. Slate Venue 2701 Custer Pkwy #905 Richardson, TX 75080 6:30 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. 7:45 p.m. – 8:00 p.m."

    "title": "Use Images and Graphics",
    "text": "This page explores how to use images in the JSOM web template. Images add life, color and emotion to a web page. Deploying images thoughtfully can make a page more useful for our visitors. Generally, we only use images that serve a specific purpose, such as: The block you’re looking at right now is the standard block for opening a page. It consists of an image with class right45, an h2 with class top-header, and some descriptive text that introduces the page. Sometimes, no image is needed or available; sometimes, many are. But one great image is often all that is needed because: Use .jpg and .png formats appropriately to optimize the file size and image quality. If someone requests an album or slideshow, we advise them to host the photo album somewhere else (such as a social media platform, where people are used to sharing and viewing photo albums), and we ask them for a representative photo for the collection and a URL for the photo album. We will display one photo on a web page, direct users to click a link if they want to see the album and provide a link to the album URL. Do not use photos as hyperlinks. Hyperlinks should primarily be in the form of text or buttons. In some cases, we use boxed text as hyperlinks.. The basic template for including an image on a page follows. Figcaptions are not always requested. Only include figcaption when it’s requested. Wrap an image with a picture element when using srcset to serve different images depending on screen width. Only include figcaption when it’s requested. Images for the web need to be optimized for the size and quality: the image should be no larger – both in pixels and bytes – than it needs to be in order to display crisply on the web page. A good way to determine the width needed for an image is to inspect the maximum width of the class you will use to size and position the image. You can review the size/position classes in the Colgrids section of Structuring a Page and look at different screen widths so you know the largest possible display width for a photo. Use Adobe Photoshop to size images. When you export the image for web, JPG images need to be set to Quality: High, which is also 60/100 on the quality slider. This quality setting is a good balance of image quality and efficient file size. (PNG files do not have a quality option.) Hero images are much larger, so save them to lower quality in Photoshop, such as Quality: Medium or 40/100. When someone requests adding a portrait of someone to a webpage, JSOM Web Services uses a 256px by 256px square template. This template keeps the size and scale of the person’s head consistent across the Jindal School web sites. In order for the image to look good and crisp, the source image needs to be high resolution, at least 256px by 256px. If the image is smaller than 256px by 256px then we will have to enlarge it, which causes image degradation. Hero images are available for high-traffic or otherwise important pages, usually top- and second-level pages. Hero images should feature a happy- or engaged-looking person or group of people doing something relevant to the web page, and the purpose of the image is to connect emotionally with the user and introduce the page’s concept. Hero images appear at the top of the content area, just below the page header, such as on the MBA home page. (This “Using Images and Graphics” page displays the hero image in the wrong location; on any other page, the hero image is the first element in the content field, so it appears directly below the template header.) Hero images are optional. Some content owners will prefer not to use them because the large image pushes other important content further down the page. See three types of hero image templates below by clicking on the call-to-action links. Standard Hero Template The large text above is brief, attention-grabbing text. The background color of this box can be any of our standard template colors; choose one that looks good with the hero image. You can include an image, with or without a caption, on the left or right side of a block of text. Images can also appear full-width above, below, or in the middle of a block of text. Use a parent class imagestory to contain both the image and the text. Then, size and position the image with the same classes used with colgrid – left25, left33, left45, left50, left55, left67, right25, right33, right45, right50, right55, right67, or fullwidth. Add the size/position class to the outermost element associated with the image, usually figure, but sometimes picture or img. Using this imagestory method allows any text that follows the image to flow around the image, depending on the screen width. See a few examples below. The figure element with left33 class contains both the photo and the caption, and depending on the screen width, the relative width of the image changes accordingly. When using classes that cause an image to float, it is important to add an empty div with class clearfix before or after the closing div of the imagestory element, which prevents elements further down the page from also flowing around the image. Just changing the size/position class or the figure element moves the image to the right. Because this image has no caption, the img element has alt=\"John Oyedele, MBA ’16\" instead of alt=\"\". For image-and-text designs that use the class full-width it is best to use an image that is not very tall and is also wide enough to be clear at full screen width, which is 1080px wide. The image above is 1080px wide by 360px tall, which is a 3:1 ratio. For images that use the class full-width, the two divs with classes imagestory and clearfix are not necessary, because the full-width image is not floating. Based on our web standard for readability, this section has replaced the imagestory class with narrow, so that the lines of text are narrower and easier to read. The JSOM web template uses different kinds of blocks for design consistency and to achieve different goals. Use the links below to see examples of the blocks and how they work. When organizing a page with colgrid, add the class fullwidth to any image that is inside one of the size/position element if you want the image to take up the full-width of that element. Containing the image with colgrid instead of imagestory separates the text and the image into distinct columns, so the text will never flow around the image. Also, on mobile the elements will stack on top of each other in the order they appear on the page. A post (as opposed to a page) should have two types of image. Below is a summary of each image. Adding one img element with the class center to the top of the post makes the post more visually and emotionally engaging. Often the image is a photo of the author of the post. If an author image is not appropriate for the post, look for a concept photo that supports the article’s theme. See the html for the post image below. <figure class=\"center\"> <img src=\"[path to image, relative if possible]\" alt=\"[describe the image for someone who can't see it]\" > <figcaption>[descriptive caption]</figcaption> </figure> As always, if a caption is not available or if it doesn’t seem necessary, then figcaption is not necessary. Each post needs a Featured image selected using the WordPress interface at the bottom of the right column of the page editor. The Featured image is what is used on Category pages and when embedding posts dynamically on a page. See below. Assistant Language Teacher, RCS Japan After graduating from Jindal School with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Limas signed up with RCS Corporation Japan, a staffing company based in Tokyo that finds English teachers for local schools. The company placed him in a job in Tokyo, where Limas now works as an assistant language teacher. In his role, he shares language skills with his students along with information about American culture and traditions. He credits opportunities to work on start-up business ideas at the Jindal School with expanding his understanding about how businesses work. Depending on the type of data to be displayed on a web page, using the grid or statistic designs are available to feature chunks of information in a clean and visually-oriented format. The info grid design is used almost exclusively to showcase student profile information, and to give users an idea of the kinds of people currently or recently in a program. An Info grid uses either colored or bolded numbers to reinforce a piece of information. In cases where the data is focused more on statistics or rankings, the stat box is the more suitable approach. Rather than using images, a stat box uses bold numbers or, sometimes, text to reinforce the message of the data. They are individually boxed up to keep information separated and easier to read. 50 675 GMAT 312 GRE 28 Business, Engineering, Psychology 3.4 36% International Countries represented: Angola, Brazil, India, Italy, Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam no.12tied / no.33tied No. 12 (tied) among public university programs and No. 33 (tied) overall, U.S. News & World Report (2021) no.1 U.S. News & World Report (2017), Top 10 Short List comparing salary-to-debt ratios of MBA graduates at ranked business schools no.15 Best Business Schools 2019, Bloomberg Businessweek no.36 Best Business Schools 2019, Bloomberg Businessweek no.6tied U.S. News & World Report (2019) no.10tied U.S. News & World Report (2020) no.17 U.S. News & World Report (2020) no.18 / no.1 No. 18 nationally and No. 1 in Texas, Bloomberg Businessweek We believe that having small, intimate programs in a big school optimizes your opportunity to meet and connect with the people who will become your lifelong social and professional network.

The Jindal School provides an engaging, intellectual learning environment that broadens perspective, stimulates originality and creativity, and encourages innovation. Art is a catalyst for ingenuity and entrepreneurship — key factors for a successful career in business. The Jindal Art Collection features a collection of both contributed and commissioned pieces utilizing various art forms, including photography, sculpture and painting. Art gifts from alumni, faculty and friends began the collection and provided the impetus to assemble permanently displayed works that students will enjoy on a daily basis. The collection reflects the diverse culture and educational endeavors of the faculty, staff, alumni and students at the Jindal School. Please support the Jindal School’s initiative to advance creativity and innovation in a world-class business education. Make a financial gift to the Jindal School Art Fund. Contact the Jindal School Office of Development and Alumni Relations for information on donating art to the collection. In 2014, Jindal School alumni, faculty, staff, corporate supporters, community friends and local artists gathered at the school to celebrate the intersection of art and business. Proceeds from the Artistic Impressions of Management event were used to commission a glass sculpture for the Jindal Art Collection. The sculpture was installed in the atrium of the Jindal School addition, which opened in August 2014. With vibrant colors and varying sizes of molded glass, the sculpture is a visual display of exploration and innovation. Jim Bowman, a local artist who has been developing expressions in glass since 1978, designed the glass sculpture, which he named Golden Flower, for the new school addition.

The last section of the book addresses those instances when failure prevention or turnarounds are not possible or desirable—and offers a pre-planned exit strategy roadmap with checklists and key considerations. The epilogue discusses other challenges and opportunities in the field of failure prevention with the emergence of machine learning."

They are intelligent, hard-working and active in research, publishing academic papers during and after they graduate from our program (see Student Publications section below). Students also develop teaching competence under faculty mentorship through teaching one or two sections of an undergraduate course, a relatively light teaching load compared to many other PhD programs’ requirements. Several of our PhD students (current and former), Nan Guo, Miranda Welbourne-Eleazar, Xiaoou Bai, Brian Pinkham, Canan Mutlu and Yasuhiro Yamakawa, won the Best Teacher Award in the “TA/PhD Instructor” category in the Jindal School of Management, indicating that they were the best instructors among over 100 PhD students of the school. Another graduate, Sergey Lebedev, won the Best Dissertation Award at the Jindal School of Management. lee.1085@utdallas.edu | (972) 883-6267 | JSOM 4.409 With a strong emphasis on training the next generation of researchers, the Organization, Strategy and International Management (OSIM) program provides students with a challenging and dynamic learning environment. Our faculty members are committed to student success in research and extensively collaborate with students on crafting research papers. Some of our faculty members, such as John Lin and Riki Takeuchi, have been recognized for their dedication to student development. The goal of the OSIM program is to educate future researchers in management. Students graduate from the program with the knowledge and skill set for producing quality research. Nearly all of our recent graduates have secured tenure-track positions at universities offering graduate degrees. Most of our students succeed in publishing quality research. Even before graduation, some students have already published their work in leading journals, often in collaboration with faculty and recent graduates. Some outlets are commonly regarded as top journals, such as the Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of International Business Studies, Management Science, Organization Science and Strategic Management Journal. Below are examples of students’ journal publications with our faculty, including those in the UTD 24 leading business journals and the Financial Times top 50 journals.

Students may enter the IMS doctoral program after previous graduate training or directly from undergraduate programs. Desirable educational backgrounds include graduate or undergraduate degrees in areas such as business administration, economics, sociology, psychology, political science, mathematics and engineering. Applicants with other academic backgrounds are considered as well. Competition to enter our program is strong. Since 2005, the IMS program only admits 3-5 students per year, representing about 5% of the total number of applicants. It is unlikely that we will increase the number of admitted students in the foreseeable future. Clearly, our emphasis is quality, not quantity. The IMS program is designed for full-time students. Since the completion of a PhD requires a time commitment that is inconsistent with full-time or part-time employment elsewhere, the school will not consider applications for part-time status. PhD students are required to work part-time (20 hours per week) for our school as a Teaching or Research Assistant. Every student receiving an assistantship will be eligible for a year-long research fellowship for four consecutive semesters (summer, fall, spring and summer). The fellowship aims to help them initiate their research activities early in the program. Students choose a faculty advisor and develop a quality research paper to be presented at the end of the fellowship year. For detailed application procedures and admission requirements, please visit our PhD Admissions page. The IMS PhD curriculum includes a business foundation, core courses, advanced seminars, a methodology requirement, directed readings and independent research courses and the dissertation. All students must take the PhD courses that are offered in each of the first two years in the program. Students must satisfy a first-year research paper requirement, which will be due at the end of the first year (also known as the preliminary exam). Students must also pass the comprehensive qualifying examination, which is administered at the end of the second year when all the relevant course requirements (Core Courses, Advanced Seminars, Research Methods) have been satisfied. It is intended to assess the student’s mastery of the fundamental theories and methodologies central to the program and to evaluate the student’s potential to do original research in an area of specialization. PhD students must successfully complete the preliminary and qualifying examinations, respectively, to enter PhD candidacy. The area faculty will determine whether a student has successfully completed the exam requirements based on the student’s performance. Criteria to evaluate students may include results from the in-class written portion of the exams, quality of research papers and/or presentations, performance in particular courses (e.g. seminar courses), satisfactory GPA as determined by area faculty and other forms of assessment as required by the student’s area. An unsatisfactory performance in any one of the criteria for either the preliminary examination or the qualifying examination may result in dismissal from the program. After passing the qualifying exam, each student writes a dissertation proposal. The proposal is defended before a faculty committee appointed in consultation with the student, dissertation chair and PhD advisor. This committee also serves as the supervising committee for the dissertation after the proposal is approved. The Dissertation Proposal must be successfully defended at least one semester prior to the term of graduation. The requirements for the proposal defense should be discussed with the dissertation committee prior to scheduling the defense. Dissertation Proposal Defenses will be open to all faculty and PhD students of the Jindal School of Management. Courses are required in strategic management, entrepreneurship, international business, organization theory and behavior, group and intergroup processes, social network theory and organizational decision-making. To prepare for a career in teaching, students take a doctoral teaching and writing seminar. Methods courses are designed to improve and develop research skills. Courses include research methodology and classes in statistics and quantitative methods. Students are encouraged to take courses related to additional methods consistent with their research interests. The PhD degree is conferred when the dissertation is successfully defended.

Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all. Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.

Download 2024 Presentation and Papers Mobilizing teams to execute change with excellence We all know that most change initiatives fail to deliver their goals, largely due to ‘people issues’, rather than the change strategies themselves Over 40 years, working in organizations around the World, I have learned many lessons on the do’s and don’t’s of effective change management to share. Project Management for the Greater Good: Lessons Learned from the Non-profit World We all know that the foundation of a good project is a well-executed plan: a plan that starts on time, follows the critical path exactly, ends on time, and is completed within budget. But what happens when your straight-line process becomes a squiggly line of stops, starts, readjustments, and start-overs? Nonprofits must navigate through uncertainties and external factors outside of the project sphere of control such as funding, volunteer labor, government policies, and the dynamic needs of clients. Hear lessons learned from navigating through uncertainties of the nonprofit world and how leaders across all business sectors can be nimble and still get things done. Leader Shift – How to develop teams of leaders instead of leaders of teams Leadership and Culture are the greatest predictors of an organization’s success. But, in a world of digital, scale, and growth – people are the most unpredictable and least uniform facet of business and projects. So, how can we create success and long-term sustainability for organizations that drive change in the marketplace? Ben and his team at TSG have helped businesses such as McDonalds, EA Games, eBay, Cox Auto, Popeyes, Signet Jewelers and 100’s of others create some of the most powerful brands in the world. Along the way, they realized the same principles that helped businesses build successful brands could be utilized to shift the way businesses develop transformational leadership, resulting in teams of leaders instead of simply leaders of teams.

    "title": "STEM Business Degree Programs",
    "text": "The Naveen Jindal School of Management offers several STEM-designated graduate programs and undergraduate programs. STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — programs keep abreast of emerging science-based advances and challenges in the world of business management, offer students flexible and versatile paths, and open doors to highly compensated in-demand jobs. As science advances and the need for professionals with the skills to solve complex problems rooted in science grows, the U.S. government allows institutions to give a STEM designation to programs that focus on science, technology, engineering and math. This designation is important because the U.S. and global economies increasingly require workers with a high proficiency in these areas. Though STEM jobs are in high demand, U.S. domestic students have shown a declining interest in the four STEM fields over the years, prompting the government to work with educational institutions to promote STEM programs. Thus, STEM-designated programs offer benefits and career opportunities for all students. STEM fields offer the fastest-growing professional career opportunities. Choosing a career in science, technology, engineering or math offers future job security, flexibility, job satisfaction and outstanding earning potential. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that STEM occupations will grow 8.8% between 2018 and 2028, compared to a 5% growth in non-STEM occupations, with a median annual wage of $85,000 among these STEM jobs. Among current Jindal School students in STEM programs, 981 have recently held internships in 737 companies. STEM-designated degrees offer domestic U.S. students the possibility of academic advancement and employment security. Moreover, there are many options, career paths and scholarship opportunities to take advantage of as a U.S. citizen. Eligible international students may obtain a 24-month OPT (optional practice time) extension to work in the United States. To learn more, visit the UT Dallas Optional Practical Training page. There are nine graduate STEM-designated programs, three undergraduate STEM-designated programs, and a variety of double-degree combinations. At the graduate level, students may choose to pursue double-degree programs (MS STEM/MBA or MS STEM/MS) and earn both degrees simultaneously. The double degree program provides an opportunity for you to potentially share coursework between the two degrees. To enter a double degree program and take advantage of possible time and tuition benefits, students must apply to and be accepted by both programs."

It let me see and understand what information technology actually is and how it helps people in their everyday life It showed me that IT was different then what I thought, which was IT only deals with computers and coding. Now I know it much broader than that. I honestly wasn’t too sure about what ITS was before this event, and I didn’t think it could be something fun that I’d enjoy, but I realized that it can be quite fun! It was fun to go to different events and try cool things and meet cool people. Overall I loved everything My favorite part about this event was the programming and the Arduino boards This in an amazing event and it was very fun and educational. Me and my friend will definitely come back next year! We loved it so much because we got to explore our interests (mine was particularly robotics and circuit board) while having a lot of fun.

    "text": "The lab staff is a group of student employees under the supervision of Dr. Liping Ma. We manage and operate JSOM Finance Lab by supporting the students, faculty and staff on research, tutoring both undergraduates and graduates and organizing Finance/Technology workshops and financial database trainings. Lab resources helped me gain deeper understanding of the financial world while simultaneously helping me become aware of wide range of things you can do while leveraging them. Databases such as Capital IQ, FactSet gave me a head start while at my time at CITI. Relationships formed with colleagues, peers and students were some of the best parts of my time at University which I will always cherish! Working with Dr. Liping Ma and serving in the finance trading lab was the favorite part of my UTD journey. I feel fortunate that I received an opportunity to join the lab right after coming to the US. Each day at work was a learning experience and helped me grow my skills including event organization, time management, and networking. I would recommend incoming JSOM students to take advantage of the lab facilities and the resources available. Being a part of Finance Trading Lab has helped me transform my professional career and made me an all-round individual. During my time at UTD, my best experience has been at the trading lab. As a top performer in the UTD stock track competition, access to financial databases at the trading was crucial to my success. In addition to that, the peer learning environment at the lab helped me enhance my skills, which made me more competitive in interviews. Overall, I can confidently say that the Trading Lab contributed to my development not only in the technical aspect but also helped me form connections and networks I will cherish forever. In spring 2021, I worked at the trading lab as a teaching assistant. As a student who joined during quarantine, it was the first time I connected with hard-working Finance students in JSOM! I strongly recommend you step into the lab and have conversations with lab workers and students. You can study as a group and access financial tools and databases in the lab. The finance lab provides various workshops, competitions, and events, which enhanced my analytical and technical skills and prepared me for the job market. As an MS Finance alumnus who currently works for a financial service company, I can proudly say that Finance Lab helped me get this job. The tableau competition and Capital IQ workshops specifically guided me on using databases and enhancing my visualization skills. The Finance Lab always welcomes everyone and feeds their curious minds. One should enter and explore the intriguing place JSOM Finance lab is! I worked in the Finance Lab from Fall 2019 to Spring 2020 as a student worker. Any day I was on campus, the Lab was a must-go stop. Like we always say: “I’ll meet you at the Lab.” The Finance lab offered some great resources to current students, whether we’re working on course-related papers, case competitions, or just want to self-learn and get familiar with some financial modeling databases. Every semester, the lab arranges a variety of events to enhance the students’ experience and provides an excellent platform for students to network and talk to professionals, professors, and alumni. During my time at the lab, I learned tools like the Morning Star, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Bloomberg, and Tableau which were very instrumental in adding an extra edge to the project work and in detailed research of financial information to solve cast studies. I continue to use the interpersonal skill and financial knowledge I imbibed at the lab in my current role as an Investment Analyst. Being a part of the lab has been a great learning experience and I hope more students get a chance to explore the lab’s resources. The experience at the Finance trading lab has been one of the most enriching periods during my MS finance course. My one and a half years at Finance lab as a Student worker, TA, and Lab manager has been a great learning experience. With Lab workers, it always felt like an extended family. The finance lab gave me a chance to not only train students on various financial concepts but also learn something from every student I have met. Hi! This is Ben (Zhiyao) Zhao, I am currently working as a full time Credit Risk Senior Analyst at Citigroup. During my time at UTD, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for Finance Trading Lab during calendar year 2020. This was one of my beautiful times at college. I not only learned necessary skills I am using day to day now, but also participated in many interesting events and made friends. Finance lab provides opportunities for students to learn and touch financial tools that many financial institutions are using. I learned how to use FactSet and Capital IQ, learned how to obtain financial resources such as projection, debt structure, and credit ratings. I also got the chance to have many leaderships experiences as organize Finance lab’s events and schedule. I was networking at Finance Lab getting to know many professionals, studying at Finance Lab to learn knowledge, and helping students to understand financial materials. This was a memorable experience I will always take in mind. The Finance Lab has been an integral part of my education and career thus far. The skills I had acquired are imperative to my work. It was here that I had learnt about S&P Cap IQ, and Bloomberg, two tools that I use on a daily basis. Aside, from the technical skills, I also got to learn about the various aspects of the Finance realm from the many different speakers that have graced the lab over time and the extraordinary peers I got to work with."

The goal is simple: who can take the skills learned throughout the program and apply them to make the most money in our virtual simulator? Do you have what it takes to be the TOP TRADER? With an initial balance of $1 million dollars of virtual currency, participants can invest in stocks, and ETFs. If that still doesn’t excite you, we are offering cash prizes to the best of the best. While the investment competition is arguably the more exciting part of the program, the educational videos and quizzes will give large dividends in terms of financial knowledge in both the short and long term. Below, you will find many videos from our staff and faculty about what they wished they had learned about investing and personal finance before going to college. Professor Polze teaches business law at UT Dallas and also serves as one of the Associate Deans of Undergraduate Education. Watch and listen to Professor Polze discuss the important of education and the economic impact it provides to students. Dr. Powell serves as the Associate Dean of Graduate Education at the Jindal School of Management. She helps oversee the school’s nationally recognized graduate and MBA programs. Dr. Powell discusses some money lessons she learned early in life that she still uses today. You have probably already heard a lot of the great things the competition provides, but here are some testimonials from former competitors and the President of the DFW Financial Planning Association. This is the DFW Financial Planning Association’s second year to endorse the competition.

Best wishes, Klaus Dohrman, PhD The tentative schedule is noted below and will be updated periodically. In a hyper-competitive market for undergraduate business-schools must offer distinct, relevant, and attractive academic and co-curricular journeys for prospective students and their parents. Many business schools have developed winning brands for decades that have helped them drive program interest and enrollment. During this session, three successful business schools will share their experience in creating a winning brand. Successful business schools have developed sophisticated marketing strategies that attracted ideal candidates for their institutions. A successful strategy can be monitored by following key metrics as applicants move through the applications pipeline. During this session, three schools will share how they have evaluated their market to create effective enrollment strategies and how they have learned how to measure outcomes to adjust their efforts. Undergraduate business school applicants expect their school of choice to offer an attractive mentoring program but developing a successful program can be daunting. Any quick review of mentoring program suggests that there is no “one-size-fits-all” model and that schools must develop their model based on their school’s assets. During this session, learn more about how three different business schools have developed successful mentoring programs that have added real value to their student’s overall experience and satisfaction. Helping students develop a global perspective in today’s complicated world has become increasingly important and competitive business schools know that students have a richer experience when they have engaged in an international component during their academic studies. During this session, several business schools share their knowledge and expertise in developing robust study abroad, exchange and international internship programs. Undergraduate students seem to have been challenged by attending streaming classes and understanding what it means to by engaging asynchronously during Covid semesters. What have we learned about what works, what does not work and how to inspire undergraduate students to commit in an unfamiliar environment? Learn from schools that have traversed this new horizon and discuss how the silver linings of virtual engagement may extend beyond our Covid semesters. Competitive business schools are finding their identity and brand through the development of distinct programs for undergraduate students. Some schools are known for their study abroad efforts or their mentoring programs, but what about Honor’s Programs, Undergraduate Research Programs and Senior Capstone Projects as programs of distinction? During this session, learn from a panel of experts who can talk about, how their school developed unique and distinct programs that provided rich and robust experiences for their students. Being successful in business is not just about acquiring technical skills, but is also about learning to communicate and influence others. Integrating communication into business curriculum has become fully appreciated by most business schools but doing it is another matter. During this session, learn how these schools have tackled integrating communications successfully into their curriculum. The conference is virtual.

He received his PhD from the University of Arizona in marketing with a minor in Economics in 1996, PGDBM (an MBA) from XLRI, and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. Best wishes, Sandeep Krishnamurthy, PhD Dean at University of Washington, Bothell The tentative schedule is noted below and will be updated periodically. The pandemic has impacted the process of recruiting new students and retaining them, and schools are rethinking their approaches. In this session, learn from a panel of experts how their schools successfully implemented innovative ways to increase their enrollment and overall retention rates. Employers seek to hire undergraduate students with strong technical skills, but often employers discover that weak or under-developed communications skills are what set students back in their careers. The communication curriculum is no longer focused on developing written and presentation skills but also on how students influence others, resolve conflicts, and build relationships. Learn from schools that have traversed this new phase and explore ways that help prepare students for success in the industry. The “great resignation” has impacted business schools substantially due to Covid. Staff desire remote work; faculty want to teach in a format that provides more flexibility, and the deans want both staff and faculty to be readily available to serve students. These shifting expectations have also impacted students as they have developed expectations to negotiate everything from assignments to how they attend class. In the end, overall performance and output have changed, and to some degree, it has decreased. This session discusses how to prepare, inspire, and re-engage faculty and staff to increase productivity, responsiveness, and quality of work. We often think that “change” is painfully slow in the academic world, but the impact of the pandemic has accelerated the change process. How do business schools get ahead of employer, parent, and student expectations? How do we adapt quickly to stay ahead of what is expected in the future? This session explores innovative approaches that some business schools have taken to get ahead and set a new bar for excellence in undergraduate education. Vendors fill our email boxes with new technologies that can positively impact student outcomes. The pandemic gave them substantial time to develop a wide array of new tools for schools to consider. However, selecting the right tools and technologies for business schools has become complicated and overwhelming for the deans. This session discusses the tools some business schools implemented to help their students and faculty, and most importantly, to increase the effectiveness of their schools’ various business processes. Since March 2020, undergraduate students have become increasingly comfortable with learning and existing in a virtual world. A virtual environment helped them be invisible to their teachers and classmates and resulted in limited classroom and co-curricular engagements since returning to face-to-face instruction in fall 2021. Helping students adjust back to face-to-face engagement will be critical if we are to prepare them for life-long career success. This session explores how business schools have invested in creating, re-engaging, and sustaining high levels of student engagement. Universities are struggling to manage the increasing demand for mental health services among college students due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students, particularly those closer to graduating, are mentally suffering from anxiety and depression, struggling with the inability to socialize and other issues due to the impact of continued isolation. Learn from universities on how they assist their students and prepare their school personnel with resources to remedy the widespread mental health issue."

Hasan Pirkul, PhD Dean and Caruth Chair of Management Dear Friends, Dr. Monica Powell is the Senior Associate Dean and Graduate Dean for the Naveen Jindal School of Management at . Her graduate business education experience spans 35 years, during which time she has held senior roles at both SMU and UT Dallas. Dr. Powell teaches at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and handles program management, the school’s Career Management Center, web services, data analytics team, academic operations, recruiting, and program support. Dr. Powell earned her PhD in Higher Education with a minor in Communications from the University of North Texas. She also earned a bachelor’s degree in communications and a master’s degree in advertising from the University of Alabama. Best wishes, Monica Powell, PhD Sr Associate Dean, UT Dallas The tentative schedule is noted below and will be updated periodically. Undergraduate degree programs are experiencing new challenges that call on senior leadership to create new strategies to address enrollment challenges and new mandates for performance by higher education coordinating boards, state legislations, and parents. Changes in expectations by students have exacerbated these challenges. As GenZ moves on to its next academic journey, the new Alpha generation will bring various demands and needs to undergraduate business schools. This session explores such challenges and suggestions for overcoming the obstacles ahead for those who lead. Today’s undergraduate programs require relevant content, combining concept and practice and curriculum delivery flexibility to attract and retain students. This session discusses how undergraduate programs are working to create an “out of the box” curriculum to ensure programs are achieving the best possible competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded education market. Retention and engagement of undergraduate students continue to evolve as students are increasingly seeking strong market-demanded programs which provide rigor, employment marketability, and personal esteem. In this session, attendees hear from leaders about how they are innovating their retention and engagement methods to ensure a high level of program success that meets the student’s value expectations. The awareness and efforts of the organization’s positive societal impact are critical for success. Undergraduate programs increasingly incorporate social impact goals to meet the demands of business and society. This session explores new approaches leaders are taking to create innovative programs that focus on developing and delivering societal impact content to meet the needs of accreditation bodies, businesses, and students. Over the few years, undergraduate leaders and students have incorporated academic software applications (such as Brainly, Blackboard, Canvass, ChatGPT, Connect, Chegg Study, GoNoodle, Kahoot, MyLab, or Zoom) to assist in providing interactive learning experiences for students. While these tools have provided innovative platforms for course curriculum delivery, they have also exposed faculty, programs, and students to higher levels of risk to academic integrity. In this session, you learn from leaders what efforts schools are taking to safely incorporate these applications to ensure high academic integrity while providing students with an interactive learning experience. A global perspective on cultural, economic, and societal issues is crucial for students’ success. As we emerge from the pandemic travel restrictions, undergraduate programs are returning to study abroad experiences to provide students with the opportunity to cultivate this perspective on their world. In this session, you hear from program leaders reestablishing study abroad programs that take advantage of many global study opportunities while overcoming the many challenges related to these efforts. Often students arrive at their university wondering who to turn to for assistance such as course selections, registration, career development, etc. At its core, the mentoring program reassures students that there is someone who cares about them and that they are not alone in dealing with the challenges of college life. In this session, program leaders discuss the development and implementation of mentor programs to ensure student success.

The School of Industrial Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology is proud to host the 14th annual Behavioral Operations Conference in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on July 7 – 10, 2019. The conference will begin with a welcome drink on Sunday evening and continue with a one-day Young Scholars Workshop on Monday, July 8, and the main conference on Tuesday and Wednesday, July 9-10. We look forward to seeing you in Eindhoven! Conference fees are: $175 for faculty and $75 for students If you are interested in presenting at the main conference or the Young Scholars Workshop, please indicate so when you register and include an extended abstract (one-page limit) of your work. Please also indicate who will present in the abstract. The conference will begin with a welcome drink on Sunday evening and continue with a one-day Young Scholars Workshop on Monday, July 8. During the Young Scholars Workshop, the group will consist of several breakout sessions and a plenary session. At the plenary session, Professor of Operations Bradley Staats of the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School will give a presentation. Professor of Operations at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School (United States of America) Field experiments are controlled interventions in the real world that enable researchers to measure the effects of a treatment on a randomly assigned subset of subjects. In this talk I will discuss review the advantages and disadvantages of field experiments and provide some practical prescriptions to attain and evaluate a field experiment’s relevance—in other words, the theoretical implications of understanding the effects of the treatment— and rigor, based on many methodological considerations. Dr. Bradley R. Staats is a professor at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School and best-selling author of Never Stop Learning: Stay Relevant, Reinvent Yourself, and Thrive. His research and teaching focus on learning and analytics. He advises individuals and organizations on how to learn and improve in order to innovate and succeed on an ongoing basis. In addition, he leads UNC’s Center for the Business of Health, a cross-campus, interdisciplinary effort to tackle the most pressing challenges in health care. Dr. Staats integrates work in operations management and human behavior to understand how and under what conditions individuals, teams and organizations can perform their best. His field-based research in such settings as health care and software services, consulting, call centers and retail, uses archival data and field experiments to provide an interdisciplinary perspective to improve both operations’ theory and practice. He publishes frequently in both leading academic journals and practitioner-focused journals. He is an associate editor at Management Science, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management and Production and Operations Management. He received his DBA in technology and operations management and MBA from Harvard Business School. He received his BS with honors in electrical engineering and his BA with high honors in Plan II and Spanish from The University of Texas at Austin. The conference will begin with a welcome drink on Sunday evening and continue with a one-day Young Scholars Workshop on Monday, July 8, and the main conference on Tuesday and Wednesday, July 9-10. Associate Professor for Behavioral Economics at University of Leuven (Belgium) As long ago as 1963, Nobel prize winner Kenneth J. Arrow argued in an article with almost 9,000 citations that the market for health care differs from other markets. Consumers usually do not face the full price of the goods and services they consume, since at least part of the price is paid for by insurance companies. In addition, consumers have limited information and thus have to trust the recommendation of an expert, the physician. The behavior of physicians, on its turn, is governed by professional norms. In this setting, many important insights into the market have been brought forward by behavioral and experimental economists. This keynote provides an overview on some of the most important findings from behavioral economics as well as some of the most famous experiments in health economics, and it discusses the main features, advantages and limitations as well as the quo vadis of these types of experiments. Iris Kesternich is Associate Professor for Behavioral Economics at the Department of Economics at the University of Leuven. Her research focuses on incentives and the interaction of market participants in health and labor markets. She is specifically interested in the influence of non-monetary incentives and social preferences on decision-making in these domains. In a current sequence of projects she analyzes the effects of the meaning of work on labor supply; the influence of professional norms on medical decision making; and the role of social preferences in situations with concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. Iris Kesternich obtained a Ph.D. in economics in 2010 from the University of Munich, and she had a position there as postdoctoral researcher until September 2014. Over the last few years she was a visiting scholar at a number of institutions such as Boston University, Harvard Health Care Policy, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Harvard Center of Population and Development Studies. She is Associate Editor of the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, a member of the board of the German Society for Health Economics (dggö), a resident visitor at the RAND Corporation, and Research Associate at the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim (ZEW); and she is affiliated to the Behavioral Experiments in Health Network. Professor of Operations Management and Logistics at Kuehne Logistics University (Germany) While the research on behavioral operations originated primarily in the field of manufacturing as less rigorous field work, and then developed into more formal experimental work in the laboratory focusing on general operations management problems, further growth of the field and new exciting problems are awaiting us by venturing into new major research problems. I will give an overview of some early work in some areas addressed by the broader OM literature, such as in humanitarian operations and healthcare. I will conclude by addressing how behavioral OM could leapfrog the broader OM by contributing to some of the societal challenges ahead, in particular relating to the future of work. Jan C. Fransoo is Professor of Operations Management & Logistics at Kuehne Logistics University in Hamburg, Germany. He also serves as the University’s Dean of Research and Member of the Executive Board. He joined KLU in 2018 following a tenure of 22 years at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, where he still holds a courtesy professorship in its School of Industrial Engineering. Professor Fransoo’s research studies operations, logistics, and supply chain management decision making in the retail, chemical, food, pharmaceutical and transport industries. His current research focuses in particular on retail distribution and channel management in developing markets, on intermodal container transport, and on sustainability and social responsibility in supply chains. His co-edited books include Behavioral Operations in Planning and Scheduling (2011), Reaching 50 Million Nanostores: Retail Distribution in Emerging Megacities (2017) and Sustainable Supply Chains: A Research-Based Textbook on Operations and Strategy (2017). Fransoo has published both modeling and empirical research in over 120 academic journal articles and book chapters. He serves as Associate Editor of Operations Research, Production and Operations Management, and Decision Sciences Journal. Jan Fransoo holds a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Operations Management and Logistics, both from Eindhoven University of Technology.

If you’d like to find alumni you went to school with, join Jindal Connect. Abinav Bayya came to the Naveen Jindal School of Management to pursue his Master of Science in Supply Chain Management. After a turbulent first semester, Bayya found himself on academic probation. Investment Analyst at Invitation Homes The experience was wonderful, learning from the JSOM professors has shaped me personally and professionally. The JSOM students there were also very intellectual and curious. It was a great educational experience. Finance Manager at Amazon My background experience was a mix of technical qualifications as a software engineer and work experience as a futures trader and Sales Finance Manager. Even though I had worked in the finance domain in different capacities, I didn’t have experience of academic finance and when looking for options for my graduate level education my priority was to complement both my previous education and work experience. The MS Finance program at JSOM not only fulfilled all the criteria but also boasted of world class faculty and a very enhanced learning program and facilities. DVC informatics Analyst at Houlihan Lokey I chose my MS degree in Finance at JSOM primarily because of the curriculum and the faculty staff. The courses taught covered all of the areas in finance and it gave the opportunity to specialize in different concentrations, such as financial technology or investment analysis. Additionally, the faculty is very well prepared and up to date in the latest research. Financial Analyst at CBRE During my research for a good graduate school, I saw that the MS in Finance at JSOM offered more than just quality education, it provided an access to huge knowledge pool and experience from the faculties and the peers alike. It had the widely diverse class with students from all around the world to learn from, while having 200+ student organizations to develop myself outside of the classroom and make friends. Being located really close to Dallas, a major city which has great opportunities also influenced my decision to enroll at JSOM. Assistant Language Teacher, RCS Japan After graduating from Jindal School with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Limas signed up with RCS Corporation Japan, a staffing company based in Tokyo that finds English teachers for local schools. The company placed him in a job in Tokyo, where Limas now works as an assistant language teacher. In his role, he shares language skills with his students along with information about American culture and traditions. He credits opportunities to work on start-up business ideas at the Jindal School with expanding his understanding about how businesses work. Investment Bank Risk Analyst, JP Morgan Sethi works at JP Morgan as a specialist in counterparty credit risk calculations, doing the heavy analysis that most don’t even know exists – he investigates and explains derivative exposure variances and changes. Sethi earned both finance and actuarial science undergrad degrees. (Actuarial science is in the UT Dallas School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.) Notably, Sethi was awarded the prestigious $15,000 Mitchell Family Foundation Scholar Award from the Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation, based on his work with CampusOven, a service that connects university employees and students with caterers who are focused on healthy eating options.

The policy of The University of Texas at Dallas is set out below. Faculty Discretion Although generally the individual instructor or the faculty should have wide discretion in the choice of materials to be used in the courses offered by the school, frequent changes in the textbooks prescribed should be discouraged and should be made only for cogent reasons. Prescribed Use Although the authorship of books, outlines, manuals and similar materials by members of the faculty and staff should be encouraged, the prescribed use of these for students is a responsibility that goes beyond that of the individual author. Where practical and equitable, the charge for outlines, syllabi, and similar materials prescribed for the use of students should be borne by the school. Whenever an approved incidental fee includes a charge for such materials distributed through the classroom, the prices should be as low as possible, consistent with the payment of any required royalty to the author or authors. Procedures Regental approval is required for all new incidental fees. Generally, approvals for such fees are considered at the February meeting of the Board. The format of incidental fee requests, including required cost data, are distributed to each School Dean. Any proposed change in the textbook of any course, within one year from the date of first adoption, shall be approved by the appropriate faculty, and a statement of the reasons for change shall be transmitted through the Dean to the Chief Academic Officer and the President. Textbooks, notebooks, manuals, or other materials for the use of students, written or prepared by a member of the faculty, shall not be prescribed for the use of students or sold to such students prior to consultation with appropriate faculty and until approved by the dean and the Provost for the President. The UTD Faculty Authored Textbook Approval Form (copy attached) shall be used for these purposes."

Conditions of Service Termination Within Appointment Period Appeal of Termination of Assistantship Responsibilities Evaluation Supervisor's Responsibilities UTDPP1075 University Policies Related to Graduate Assistants Teaching Assistants Teaching Associates and Student Research Assistants Policy Statement Philosophy Graduate programs, schools, or departments and eligible administrative units are designed to provide the opportunity for individuals to make the transition from students to professional scholars and practitioners. The appointment of a graduate student as a Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate often provides the student with the necessary financial support to facilitate this transformation. Teaching Assistants, Research Assistants, Graduate Assistants, and Teaching Associates are enrolled, full-time graduate students taking a minimum of nine approved semester credit hours each regular (long) semester and must be in academic good standing each semester they are appointed. Students holding these appointments normally are not allowed to accept outside employment. In those very rare cases when it is appropriate for the student to seek limited employment beyond the appointment, written permission must be obtained from both the individual’s supervisor (in accordance with UTDPP1102) as well as the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies from the appropriate School. Assistants and Associates are also employees of the University and are expected to meet specified teaching, research, or administrative support obligations and receive compensation for contributing to the mission of the University. Assistants and Associates will be reviewed and assessed on their work performance on a semester-by-semester basis. As employees of the University, Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, and Teaching Associate appointees, when acting in their capacity as employees, are subject to the provisions of policies and procedures relating to employment, including the provisions and requirements governing intellectual property. Graduate studies and assistantship responsibilities should reinforce each other. The appointments are intended to allow the student to gain valuable in-service experience in teaching, research, administrative functions, and other activities. Research projects should ideally lead to a thesis or dissertation. Teaching assignments should give greater insight into a student's discipline. Administrative responsibilities could include research; in such cases, these duties should give a graduate student an opportunity to apply collaborative communication strategies in planning, executing, and assessing projects or to apply research concepts, practices, and methodologies when conducting institutional research. In all cases, a close relationship between the faculty or administrative supervisor and the student is vital to the promotion of the professional growth of the graduate student. Types of Graduate Assistantships A Teaching Assistant (TA), Research Assistant (RA), Graduate Assistant (GA), and Teaching Associate holding a half-time appointment in any college or school at UT Dallas will be expected to devote an average of twenty hours per week to assistantship duties. Non-immigrant international students must abide by the terms of their visa status and immigration guidelines based on total hours worked. Four types of assistantships are offered: Full-time (0.5 FTE personnel appointments) Graduate Student Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be expected to devote an average of twenty hours per week to assistantship duties to help meet the instructional needs of the university. Appointments and reappointments as Teaching Assistants are subject to: the availability of financial support, satisfactory academic progress, and performance review by their academic program, school, or department on a semester-by-semester basis. In consultation with, and under the direction of, an assigned supervisor, the Teaching Assistant will aid in the teaching of one or more courses or may serve as the instructor of record. Full-time (0.5 FTE personnel appointments) Graduate Student Research Assistants (RAs) will be expected to devote an average of twenty hours per week to assistantship duties to assist the research efforts of the faculty in a capacity that relates to the student's educational goals. Research Assistant appointments and reappointments are subject to: the availability of financial support, satisfactory performance in and progress toward specified research assignments, and performance review on a semester-by-semester basis. The Principal Investigator or Project Director of the award will designate and supervise the research activities of the Research Assistant. Duties may include library searches, field work, laboratory experiments, and preparation of reports. The duties should provide an opportunity to acquire professional skills that complement his/her graduate program and must not be for services unrelated to the student's educational program, school, or department or be clerical in nature. Full-time (0.5 FTE personnel appointments) Graduate Student Assistants (GAs) will be expected to devote an average of twenty hours per week to assistantship duties to assist with administrative support functions and other activities in a manner that relates to the student's professional development. Graduate Assistant appointments and reappointments are subject to: the availability of financial support, satisfactory performance in specified administrative assignments, satisfactory progress in the academic program, and a satisfactory performance review on a semester-by-semester basis. The Graduate Assistant's responsibilities may or may not directly relate to teaching or research while some duties may be both research and administrative in nature, or consist of other activities that do not generally fit within the Teaching Assistant, Teaching Associate, or Research Assistant responsibilities. Depending on the specific job duties, Graduate Assistants may apply research concepts, practices, or methodologies through analyzing data, presenting findings, conducting institutional research, collaborating with co-workers and/or colleagues in preparing reports and/or presentations, and similar activities. In all cases, their duties should not be clerical in nature. The administrative supervisor will designate and manage the activities of the Graduate Assistant. The administrative supervisor will ensure that the Graduate Assistant activities will contribute to the graduate student's professional growth in acquiring professional skills that complement his/her graduate interests and/or discipline, although these skills may not necessarily relate to his/her progression toward a degree. It is required that the administrative supervisor maintains communication with the student's faculty advisor about the student's appropriate academic progress and administrative performance. Full-time (0.5 FTE personnel appointments) Graduate Student Teaching Associates will be appointed, with prior written approval of the Chief Academic Officer, as the primary instructor of record for a course. The Teaching Associate serving as a primary instructor will work closely with an assigned faculty supervisor. To be eligible for appointment as the primary instructor of record for a course, Teaching Associates must be in the last phase of either their doctoral program or the Master of Fine Arts, as applicable; must have completed 18 semester credit hours in the teaching discipline; and should participate in professional development initiatives led by the Office of Graduate Education and the Center for Teaching and Learning. Appointments and reappointments as Teaching Associates are subject to: the availability of financial support, satisfactory academic progress, and performance review by their academic program, school, or department on a semester-by-semester basis. Qualifications/Eligibility for Assistantship Appointments To be eligible for appointment as a full-time Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate students must be unconditionally admitted to a graduate program/school and be enrolled full-time in a graduate program/school at UT Dallas. Students appointed as Assistants and Associates are required to maintain academic good standing as defined in the graduate catalog. Students on academic probation may not be appointed to, or remain on, an assistantship. Exceptions may be approved by the Graduate Dean upon recommendation of the School Dean and/or the administrative supervisor. For teaching appointments, proficiency in spoken and written English is required. At the time of their initial appointments as Teaching Assistants or Teaching Associates, international students will be required to take an oral screening test designed to establish their English communication skill level. The outcome of the test will establish if the student will be required to enroll in, and subsequently pass, an English as a Second Language (ESL) course designed to prepare them for classroom duties and interactions with students. Students who are not excused from taking the ESL course by the Graduate Dean must pass the ESL course within two semesters of enrollment to qualify for continued appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate. Additional information about the screening test and the ESL course may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Education. A faculty committee in each program, school, or department must screen, rank, and recommend the appointment or reappointment of Teaching Assistants, Research Assistants, and Teaching Associates in that academic unit. Evaluation criteria for entering students must include, but not necessarily be limited to, previous academic record (degree, GPA), TOEFL scores if applicable, standardized examination scores if required by the program (GRE, GMAT), applicable teaching or work experience, letters of recommendation, and the Committee's judgment that the student has the potential for sustained achievement in the chosen field of graduate study. Eligible administrative units may follow their current personnel practices in screening, ranking, and recommending the appointment or reappointment of Graduate Assistants in consultation with faculty in the student's academic discipline. Reappointment of students will also require: completion of a required assistantship orientation training program; a demonstrated high standard of performance in the areas of assigned duties in teaching, research, and/or administrative support; and satisfactory progress toward the graduate degree. Appointment Procedures The appointment of a Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, or Graduate Assistant requires recommendation by the program, school and/or department head (if applicable) or the administrative supervisor and the Dean of the School and approval by the Dean of Graduate Education. Teaching Associate appointments must also be approved by the Office of the Chief Academic Officer. In the case of an administrative unit, the appointment of Graduate Assistants requires the recommendation by the supervisor and his/her manager. All requests for initial appointment, reappointment, or change of status of Assistants or Associates must be initiated on the appropriate Human Resources forms, and must include the academic level of the student in the degree program at UT Dallas (Master's or Doctoral). For Teaching Assistants and Associates, the course or courses for which assistance is to be rendered should be specified on a semester-by-semester basis. A Teaching Assistant or Associate cannot be enrolled in the same course or courses for which their assistance is required. For Research Assistants, the name of the faculty member whose research is to be assisted should be specified. For Teaching Associates, the name of the course and the name of the faculty member who will supervise the Teaching Associate should be specified. In addition, all Teaching Assistants, Research Assistants, Teaching Associates, and Graduate Assistants must complete, sign, and return to their program, school and/or department head a statement confirming the understanding and acceptance of the Responsibilities of U.T. Dallas Graduate Student Teaching Assistants, Teaching Associates, and Research Assistants or Graduate Assistants. This agreement must be completed in the semester of initial appointment and at the beginning of each fall semester thereafter. Because the terms of individual awards may vary from program to program, and even within a single program, the program, school, and/or department head (if applicable) and/or School Dean, and the administrative supervisor or his/her manager are responsible for forwarding to each prospective Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant or Teaching Associate an official letter of appointment specifying complete information on the terms of the assistantship, including: title, fraction of effort, and length of appointment; level of assistantship financial support; minimum student course load; description of duties; name of supervisor; information concerning the required assistantship orientation program and sessions for teaching appointees; and deadline for acceptance. If specific information on items 4 and 5 is unavailable at the time of appointment, the information should be furnished in writing no later than the first class day of the semester. Specific program, school, and/or department or administrative unit policies, if any, governing Teaching Assistants, Research Assistants, Graduate Assistants and/or Teaching Associates should be communicated in writing. Length and Terms of Appointment and Reappointment to Assistantships Initial appointments starting in the fall semester may be for an academic year or for a single semester. Initial appointments starting in the spring or summer semester will terminate no later than the end of the summer semester. Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant or Teaching Associate reappointment is not automatic. Students may be reappointed if it is determined that reappointment is to the benefit of the institution. Reappointment may be for an academic year or for a single semester. Failure to maintain qualifications for the appointment and/or meet the conditions of service, including performance standards may lead to the termination of an assistantship. The maximum duration of assistantship support provided to students pursuing master's degrees is normally four semesters, whether regular (long) or summer semester. An additional semester of support may be provided for qualified students in degree options requiring more than 36 semester credits. It is recommended that students confer with their program, school, or department head and/or School Dean or the administrative supervisor to clearly establish/define such limits and other restrictions that may apply. Appointments and reappointments are subject to the availability of funds. Subject to the availability of funds and continued reappointment by the program, school, or department, the maximum period of teaching assistantship support of students enrolled in a doctoral program is 12 semesters, whether regular (long) or summer semester or 100 doctoral level semester credit hours (whether taken at UT Dallas or another public institution in Texas). It is strongly recommended that students confer each semester with their program, school, or department head (if applicable) and/or School Dean to clearly establish/define the status of their appointment, the number of doctoral hours of eligibility remaining for the student, and other restrictions that may apply. Conditions of Service As conditions of service (appointment and reappointment) the graduate student must: be in good academic standing with the program, school, and/or department and the University; be making satisfactory and timely progress toward the appropriate degree; be enrolled on a full-time basis (minimum of 9 credit hour enrollment each regular (long) semester); the required course load in the summer session will be designated by the Dean of the School; have been evaluated by supervisor as having performed satisfactorily on assigned tasks in accordance with program, school, department, and University policies and procedures; and have been in compliance with all requirements, including additional outside work, as specified in \"Responsibilities of UT Dallas Graduate Student Teaching Assistants, Teaching Associates, and Research Assistants\" or \"Responsibilities of UT Dallas Graduate Assistants.\" Termination Within Appointment Period If any of the qualifications for the appointment and/or the conditions of service, including performance standards are NOT satisfied, the program, school, and/or department head (if applicable) and/or School Dean (in the case of Teaching Assistants or Teaching Associates) or the research supervisor (in the case of Research Assistants) or the administrative supervisor (in the case of Graduate Assistants) will inform the student that grounds exist for termination of his/her assistantship, the nature of the grounds for termination, an explanation of the evidence to support the grounds, and provide the student with the opportunity to respond to an intent to terminate the assistantship. If, after providing the student with an opportunity to respond, the program, school, and/or department head (if applicable) and/or School Dean or research or administrative supervisor determines that the termination should proceed, he/she will then make a written request of the School Dean to proceed with the termination of the appointment. Upon review and concurrence, and in consultation with the Office of Human Resources, the School Dean will inform the student, in writing, of the decision to terminate the appointment. The termination will take effect on the date specified in the notification to the student from the School Dean. Appeal of Termination of Assistantship Any student holding a graduate student appointment at UT Dallas has the right to appeal a decision leading to the termination of an assistantship within the appointment period. The appeal by the student must be made in writing to the Graduate Dean within 10 working days of the date of the notification of the termination of the student's assistantship. The request for reconsideration must be concise. The student is encouraged to attach copies of all relevant statements, documents (written or electronic material) on the matter in support of his/her appeal. The student should also include a clear statement of the student's desired outcome of the appeal process. The Office of Graduate Education will convene a review panel consisting of the Graduate Dean, an Associate Dean or designee, and a faculty member from a school other than that of the student. The panel will review all submitted materials, will meet with the supervisor who terminated the assistant or associate and the student to provide the opportunity for additional clarifications as appropriate. The student will be notified in writing of the outcome of the appeal within 10 working days of the date the student's written appeal is received by the Graduate Dean. The decision of the review panel will be final. Responsibilities The Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate is expected to work closely with the faculty, research, or administrative supervisor in carrying out assigned teaching/research/administrative duties and also to make good progress toward the completion of his/her degree program. The Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate is obligated to maintain and enforce standards of academic honesty and integrity and to report violations of these to the faculty/research/administrative supervisor. The Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate is expected to keep well informed of program, school, department, and University regulations and follow them consistently. The Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate is expected to maintain all records pertinent to his or her assignment and to transfer them as and when requested by his or her supervisor. Evaluation Evaluation of performance is a critical part of the assistantship experience and should involve ongoing communications between the Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate and faculty/research/administrative supervisor(s). The School, or, if delegated, program and/or department or administrative unit, is responsible for establishing appropriate procedures for a formal evaluation to occur semesterly for associates and assistants who are instructors of record and at least annually for assistants who are not instructors of records. These evaluations help the student identify strengths and weaknesses, will be a part of the graduate student's employment record, and will also provide an avenue for assistants/associates to assess their work from their own perspectives. Supervisor's Responsibilities The supervisor of a Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate is expected to inform and advise the Assistant/Associate directly in matters which pertain to performance. The supervisor should inform a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate specifically of all curricular matters in the course (e.g., content, methods, objectives, and standards) and provide advice in teaching techniques and teacher/student relations. The supervisor of a Research Assistant should establish research goals with the assistant, which assures that the assistant has the opportunity to learn proper research procedures and techniques and which contribute to the assistant's growth as a scholar. The administrative supervisor of a Graduate Assistant should inform the assistant by outlining the administrative and/or research duties and other activities to be carried out which contribute to the professional growth as a practitioner. The supervisor is responsible for apprising the Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate of the nature of records to be kept in the course of performance of the assigned duties and of the disposition of these records required at the termination of the assignment. For Teaching Assistants and Teaching Associates, such records may include grade sheets, copies of quizzes or examinations, and student reports. For Research Assistants, they may include laboratory notebooks, primary data, and computer runs. For Graduate Assistants, they may include pertinent university information, files, emails, and institutional research data. These examples are not all-inclusive. The supervisor is responsible for ongoing communication regarding the quality of the Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, Graduate Assistant, or Teaching Associate performance. The supervisor is the primary evaluator of this performance.

    "text": "UTDPP1121 Academic Freedom - Policy Navigator - The University of Texas at Dallas Home Academic/Faculty Policies UTDPP1121 Policy Sections Policy Statement Related Policies UTDPP1121 Academic Freedom Policy Statement The University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) is committed to upholding and preserving academic freedom and the tenets of free, open inquiry and expression that underlie it. Academic freedom protects intellectual integrity and encourages open discourse, inquiry, debate, and respect, and is integral to the pursuit of knowledge. UT Dallas is determined to protect academic freedom by fostering a community in which scholarship, research, and free expression thrive. In accordance with the Association of University Professors' 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, UT Dallas recognizes academic freedom as the freedom to conduct the fundamental activities of a community of scholars and students: the freedom to learn, the freedom to teach, and the freedom to develop and share knowledge with the community - all without fear of censorship or retaliation. Reasoned arguments for or against any idea - even if controversial or offensive - are critical to this process as \"controversy is at the heart of the free academic enquiry\" (AAUP 1940 Statement). UT Dallas concurs with the AAUP 1940 Statement that \"the common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition.\" No UT Dallas policy or procedure shall infringe on academic freedom, due process, or other protected rights. UT Dallas' network of academic governance committees work together to ensure the University has procedures to safeguard academic freedom. Faculty who believe their academic freedom has been infringed upon can discuss the matter with the Committee on Faculty Standing and Conduct. Faculty also have recourse to the Faculty Grievance Procedure UTDPP 1050. The following section from UT System Board of Regents' Rule 31004 upholds the rights outlined by the American Association of University Professors and the University. \"Section 1 Freedom in Research. Faculty members are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results. Section 2 Freedom in the Classroom. Faculty members are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his or her subject but are expected not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter that has no relation to his or her subject. Section 3 Clarification of Role. Faculty members are citizens, members of learned professions, and officers of an educational institution supported by the State of Texas. When the faculty member speaks or writes as a citizen, he or she should be free from institutional censorship or discipline but should make it plain that the faculty member is not an institutional spokesperson. Section 4 Primary Duties. The primary duties of a member of the faculty are to: 4.1 Teaching. Teach in the classroom, laboratory, seminar, or clinical setting. 4.2 Research. Study, investigate, discover, create, and develop professionally. 4.3 Administration. Perform curricular tasks auxiliary to teaching and research, e.g., serving on faculty committees, attending to administrative and disciplinary tasks, fostering intellectual curiosity and integrity in the student body. 4.4 Contribution to Society. Use their professional expertise to benefit society.\" Faculty--and all members of the UT Dallas community tasked with faculty duties--are free to express their opinions and use their professional expertise to carry out their teaching, research, administrative responsibilities and external academic activities. Limitations on academic freedom undermine the greater purpose of institutions of higher education, to the detriment of the common good. Academic freedom does not grant the right to violate UT Dallas policies including, but not limited to, UTDPP1100 (Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment) and UTDPP1101 (Outside Activity Policy for All Employees, Excluding Executive Officers and Employees Involved in Procurement Activities or Contract Management). Related Policies Regents' Rule 31004 - Rights and Responsibilities of Faculty Members Regents' Rule 30104 - Conflicts of Interest, Conflict of Commitment, and Outside Activities UTDPP1100 - Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment UTDPP1101 - Outside Activity Policy: Executive Officers and Employees Involved in Procurement Activities or Contract Management UTDPP1102 - Outside Activity Policy for All Employees, Excluding Executive Officers and Employees Involved in Procurement Activities or Contract Management UTDPP1027 - Committee on Faculty Standing and Conduct Links Permalink Printable Version PDF Version Last Reviewed Unknown History Issued: 2023-02-06 Return to Top"

Course requirement consists of core courses, IT elective courses, and free elective courses. Core courses provide foundational knowledge regarding information technology and management practices and serve as the foundation for understanding the complex issues that occur at the interface between IT and business. IT elective courses provide students with opportunities to learn specialized knowledge in one or more focused tracks and free elective courses enable students to select courses that maximize their individual educational and professional goals. Detailed course requirements for the MS ITM degree may be found in the following section. To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS degree. Prerequisite Students pursuing the Master of Science in Information Technology Management degree program are required to complete one semester credit hour of MAS 6102 Professional Development course.
